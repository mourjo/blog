I think it is very apt for open-source contributions too. Software building is as much about the human society we live in, as it is about the engineering of it.</p> <p>Giving back – even in its tiniest form – reaps happiness, fulfillment and on some level, a connection with people who share our tiny slice of Earth’s unending history.</p> <p>A long time ago, I wrote a small utility, very specific for <a href="https://medium.com/helpshift-engineering/a-study-in-parallelising-tests-b5253817beae">my (very niche) use case</a>. I had no expectation of anyone even hearing about it, let alone use it. The idea was simple - a mechanism to concurrently redefine a function in Clojure. There was only one intended user: me. But for some inexplicable reason, in 2019, I put it out in the open as a <a href="https://gist.github.com/mourjo/c7fc03e59eb96f8a342dfcabd350a927">Github gist</a>.</p> <p>I recall Matthew Davidson reaching out to me to extract it into <a href="https://github.com/mourjo/dynamic-redef/tree/main">a library</a>, which Matthew also mentioned in a <a href="https://modulolotus.net/blog/2022-06-22-tidd/">blog post</a> in 2022. Today, the original gist has 29 chats and the library has been <a href="https://clojars.org/me.mourjo/dynamic-redef">downloaded 509 times</a> and with 19 stars on Github.</p> <p>It’s not a lot, but to me, it means the world: 19 people found the idea interesting, which is 19 more than what I had anticipated. If you would like to <a href="https://github.com/mourjo/dynamic-redef/tree/main">contribute</a>, you will forever have my gratitude, as do the authors of all the open source libraries I use every day.</p> <p class="copy"> See anything to improve? <a href="https://github.com/mourjo/blog/tree/master/_posts/2025-05-17-humbling-oss-experience.md">Edit this post</a>! </p> </article> <div class="giscus"></div> </main> <div class="footer"> <a href="/blog/">Blog</a> &#124; <a href="/cv">CV</a> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
