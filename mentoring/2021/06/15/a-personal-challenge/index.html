I decided to help him with this endeavour. Being from a non-technical background, his knowledge of Computer Science is limited to high school HelloWorlds. It is both a huge responsibility and honour for me to be part of his journey. My paramount goal is to ensure the gets a <em>good enough</em> guidance to venture into this field. The weight of being able to show the right path is heavy, but it is worth trying.</p> <p>Here’s what I have in mind (it is probably going to change). I have created the following broad headings of what I think are the most useful areas to spend time on.</p> <ol> <li>CS fundamentals <ul> <li>Computer Architecture</li> <li>Networking</li> <li>Operating Systems</li> <li>Databases</li> <li>Basics of a compiler</li> </ul> </li> <li>Programming <ul> <li>Javascript basics from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#claim-cert-block">FreeCodeCamp</a></li> <li>Data structures</li> <li>Algorithms</li> <li>Problem solving (something like <a href="http://leetcode.com">Leetcode</a>)</li> <li>Functional languages / OOP</li> </ul> </li> <li>Tooling workflows <ul> <li>Linux CLI</li> <li>Git</li> <li>Visual Studio Code</li> </ul> </li> <li>Web Development (after 1) <ul> <li>Server / Client</li> <li>Web scale, components, technologies</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>I pondered a lot on which language and IDE to suggest for him to learn. Eventually I concluded that Javascript and VS Code seem to be the most ubiquitous combination there is for web development. <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/courses/full-stack-web-development">Lambda School</a> also seems to be favouring Javascript.</p> <p>The list above is biased on what I think I am good enough to guide with. Much to the same reason, there is no mention of machine learning or frontend technologies like CSS, although a bit of that might be necessary.</p> <p>At the end of six months from now, based on the progress, my objective is for him to be ready for applying to coding bootcamps like <a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Centre</a>. If not that, then with some more work, a candidate for applying to junior engineering positions, like I did back in 2015 – only better than what I was back then.</p> <p>In an effort to prove to myself that I could take on this long and ardous (and eventually rewarding) journey, I hope to publish regular posts here about the progress I am making as a guide, so stay tuned and if you’re reading this, wish me luck!</p> </article> </main> <div class="footer"> <a href="/blog/">Blog</a> &#124; <a target="_blank" href="https://mourjo.me/cv.pdf">CV</a> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
