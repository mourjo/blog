I am almost never the tallest person in the room either.It is a lost game, in my opinion, the pursuit of being the best at anything in a world of 8 billion people. Trying to be the best or rather, trying to be portrayed to be the best, incentivises the wrong behaviour. Admitting that I am not the smartest person in the room unburdens me from proving to an external observer and to myself, that I am the smartest.I can instead utilise every opportunity to learn from anyone who has an interesting idea – be it the college graduate who only joined the team last week or the veteran who has been often called an outdated dinosaur. Here is a list of things I would never have learnt about if smartness ego battles got in the way (battles I would have miserably lost): Communicating sequential processes and core/async in Clojure The practice of note-taking in Obsidian and the second brain Hexagonal architecture A laser printer’s relation to open source Better command line tools written in Rust Courage to do the right thing when it is not easyI am never going to be the smartest person in the room, but I can be the person who wants to learn the most in the room – and then come out of that room a relatively smarter version of myself." } , { "title" : "Relevance of Developer Tooling in the Age of AI", "url" : "/blog/musings/2024/12/06/dev-tooling-in-the-age-of-ai/", "date" : "06 Dec 2024", "description" : "I have worked with unconventional languages all throughout my career - from Clojure and Elixir to bash and lately, Perl. Whether statically typed or not, the success of a language today depends heavily on the developer tooling and developer experience.Code is only just a means to an end — the end being value addition for the customer. Languages with extensive tooling make it easier for developers, thereby increasing their value proposition to the business. I find that the effectiveness of the median developer is dependent on a language’s tooling support - finding usages of a method, renaming a method, stepping through a codepath just to see where something gets updated, and so on…This is the kind of accidental complexity that today’s tech ecosystem is ossified by – missing language capabilities being solved with tooling has led to an over-reliance of developers on the tooling rather than the language itself. Think about it — would you write Java without Lombok or boilerplate code generation? It’s hard to imagine a surer sign that one is dealing with an irrational economic system than the fact that the prospect of eliminating drudgery is considered to be a problem. – David Graeber, Bullshit Jobs: A TheoryWith LLMs to assist developers writing code, I think the value proposition of developer tooling will take a new shape. There will always be a need for some sort of tooling, but it may turn out to be general-purpose tools, rather than language-specific ones that win.In a world where the barrier to entry into coding is lower, the test of a language’s success will depend solely (and rightly) on its ability to deliver business value. If a language is fundamentally more effective in doing so – irrespective of its tooling – it may come out on top in the age of AI.After years of working with Java (and relying heavily on the tooling ecosystem), I will now be betting on Clojure. It is just simpler, and easier, and less occluding to write expressive code in Clojure. It requires fewer lines. It requires fewer characters. It requires fewer hours. It requires fewer mental gymnastics. Lisp (Clojure) is functional. And the future is looking very functional to me. – Uncle Bob" } , { "title" : "Motivation Is Not Everything", "url" : "/blog/musings/2024/12/03/motivation-is-not-everything/", "date" : "03 Dec 2024", "description" : "This year, I did not miss a single day of learning French on Duolingo, even if only forfive minutes.

Over the years, I remember comparing my palm side-by-side to his - it is an almost identical copy of Dadua’s. In fact, I would say it with pride – a cherished emblem that I carried with a sense of honour. When I heard the heartbreaking news at three in the morning, my immediate response was to look at my own palm in the dim light of the smartphone, not knowing what this meant or how to feel about it.I kept staring at my palm in the engulfing darkness of the cold Dutch night.As a child of parents with transferable jobs, my boyhood unfolded across various locations: Alipore, Birbhum, Bardhaman and Salt Lake. One place that was constant throughout was Lake Temple Road and Dadua. My earliest memories as a child were with Dadua. His cane with an elephant’s trunk curve at the end, his fast strides which were so hard for my short legs to keep up with, the crisp morning air of Rabindra Sarobar lake before day break, and of course the “notun jinish dekhbo” which was an euphemism for toys without my mother realising I am asking for something new.While I was too young to fully remember the morning walks I took with Dadua, fragments of those memories linger in my mind. I recall moments such as meeting his friends by the lake, to the local chaiwalla who knew precisely what everyone wanted, to the almost superhero names I had for each of his friends (like Amloki-dadu and Bhim-dadu). Sometimes in the evenings he would take me for a walk around the lake as well, but this time, it was not to meet his friends, but to have a Vadilal ice cream and sometimes freshly roasted peanuts. To this day, the smell of warm peanuts takes me back to that time. I was old enough when I got the news of him passing away in his sleep, yet deep down, I was still the little boy who yearns for one more morning walk with his grandfather.I kept staring at my palm in the engulfing darkness of the cold Dutch night.In Bardhaman, we resided in an expansive estate adorned with boundless fields of crops and parks full of flowers and orchards teeming with trees. I remember Dadua took me on a tour of the estate sharing his knowledge about crops and the art of nurturing plant life. As a lifelong gardener himself, he imparted a wealth of wisdom to my uncomprehending preadolescent ears.Although I may not recall the intricacies of gardening techniques, certain moments are indelibly engraved as if they were from last week. One such recollection is him showing me how to collect dried seeds from different fruits and use them as beads to play with and make little craft items of it. Of all the toys I received as gifts that birthday in Bardhaman, today I seem to only recall this: a concoction of odd plant seeds that remain etched in memory because of the loving embrace of a grandfather and the spark of creativity that was so very characteristic of Dadua.He not only was creative himself, but ignited creativity in others too. I daresay, my mother’s fondness for recitation was kindled by Dadua. During one summer, I made a toy “smart” watch from a piece of black cardboard and a few hand-drawn digital dials. Mimi took me to a tailor to procure an elastic strap for the watch band, and with Dadua’s assistance, we assembled it all together. While I merely did it to emulate all the watch-wearing grown ups around me, Dadua confided in me that as a boy he also used scrap material as a child to craft things. This early inclination eventually led him to create his vast collection of handmade artefacts. I recall he said to me a few years later that art is different to each of us – everyone looking at the same tree but since every other person is seeing it from a different vantage point, it is not really the same tree they are looking at – everyone’s impression of the same tree is different.I kept staring at my palm in the engulfing darkness of the cold Dutch night.Atop the four-storey building on Lake Temple Road, was a sanctuary of lush platlife – all meticulously tended to by Dadua. For the longest time, Lake Temple felt akin to the story of Charlie’s chocolate factory, only healthier – abounding with banana, papaya, cauliflower, coriander, mango, pumpkin, chillies, shojne, and the lemons. On numerous occasions, Dadua would take my brother and me to the roof to pick out lemons straight from the tree. As we plucked the fruit from the plant, the natural aroma of the gondhoraj lemons permeated the air while we helped him bag the lemons for us to take home.At one point of time, there was even a water reservoir to cultivate fish on the same rooftop.Picture this: smack in the heart of the urban grey slate of Calcutta, a green nugget of nature nestled in the unlikely location of a rooftop, tended to by one man - where plant and waterlife thrived alike. I would call that Eden on Earth, wouldn’t you?আমার মুক্তি আলোয় আলোয় এই আকাশে আমার মুক্তি ধুলায় ধুলায় ঘাসে ঘাসেDadua was a man at one with nature, and nature reciprocated that connection. He used to often tell us that plants have feelings and plants understand when they are cared for. During his younger days, he ventured far and wide in search of plants that were uncommon and unthinkable to grow on small pots. The mango plant for instance, that grew on a pot and bore fruit all throughout the year, was an accomplishment that filled him particularly with pride.I kept staring at my palm in the engulfing darkness of the cold Dutch night.As I grew from a toddler to “a young man”, as he would phrase it, Dadua shared stories, folktales, Sanskrit slokas and poems with me and my brother. He tried his best to instil in us the wisdom from passages from many pieces of literature. Long before I could grasp the concept of religion, I had already committed to memory some of the verses from Ma Durga’s prayers. Even these days during Ashtami anjali, the verse “Sarbamangala Mangalyay” triggers the memory of Dadua sitting on is armchair, with his red book of Hindu Slokas in his hand reading passages out to us in the backdrop of the soft rustling of leaves from the trees he planted in the driveway of Lake Temple road.Dadua was known to be a master-reciter, with the innate ability to recall thousand-line poems like he was reading an invisible paper in front of him. Once on Rabindrajayanti at the Lake, he brought me to one of his performances. Although I did not understand the poem, I did understand that everyone’s attention was pinned on his recitation. He taught me many poems from the “Sishu” collection of Tagore’s poems made specifically for children.মনে করো যেন বিদেশ ঘুরে মাকে নিয়ে যাচ্ছি অনেক দূরে তুমি যাচ্ছ পালকিতে মা চড়ে আমি যাচ্ছি রাঙা ঘোড়ার ‘পরে I kept staring at my palm in the engulfing darkness of the cold Dutch night.Dadua was a captivating storyteller. As I grew older, the stories he told me also took a more mature form. What were stories from the Ramayan and Mahabharat, became anecdotes from his own life and choices that defined who he was. He recounted the river next to his childhood home in Comilla where fishermen sold fish right after catching it, his boyhood days spent in his school Ishwar Pathshala, his meeting Rabindranath Tagore, about his aspirations for going to art school, fond recollections of his mother, whom he lost at an early age, of the stern yet spirited chancellor of BE college of yesteryear and of Vergese Kurian, founder of Amul, who was his classmate at National Dairy Research Institute in Bangalore.His home in SN Banerjee Road was close to Anadi Cabin. On the day of his graduation from BE College, he recalled how much he enjoyed a plate of Mughlai Parathas – he fondly recalled that the owner of the restaurant (I think Anadi himself) decided not to charge him when he found out it was his graduation day.I felt a profound connection to his stories, bupt none more than those centred around Kurseong and Keventer’s. Even till this day, a trip to Darjeeling is incomplete without visiting Keventer’s restaurant. His stories always took me to faraway hill stations that he visited – sometimes to supervise tea estates – sometimes to overlook another part of his business. On one occasion, he told us how he found his way to a cabin when his car had broken down in a hilly deserted forest, and in his hour of despair, he met a classmate from BE college.I kept staring at my palm in the engulfing darkness of the cold Dutch night.Mimi’s passing marked the end of what I recall as childhood. The house became quieter and both Dadua and Dia suddenly seemed to age overnight. Thus began a different era in Lake temple. Over the ensuing years, Dadua got ill a few times. After coming back from the hospital one time, he was quite frail and could barely make it to the dining table. Words that will forever keep ringing in my ears were “Dadua kheyecho” (he used to call me “Dadua” as well) – even in the weakest moments, he was still enquiring about my well-being. Lake temple right there, as it was, and as it is today, will always be defined by moments like these – transforming what I used to call “Daduar bari” to much more than a house and into something greater than myself, a cornerstone and source of eternal strength.I kept staring at my palm in the engulfing darkness of the cold Dutch night.The day after I got the news, I was looking for some photos of Dadua – I found many of Dia’s, only a few of Dadua’s. In one of them during bhai-phota, Dadua was there just in the background. I was about to scroll past it when it struck me that that was him in his true essence – ever present and away from the limelight. Even then, there was one photo on a warm summer’s noon, when he was front and centre, smiling as bright as the sun overhead. Being the eldest, I was the first in my generation to get a job. Mimi had long left for the heavenly abode and in the ensuing five years, the deepest sense of pride I ever allowed myself was when using my own money, I bought Dadua a Panjabi and Dia a saree. Oh you should have been there to see his smile. He didn’t have the habit of dressing up or going outside to restaurants but in his words “it’s to celebrate my Dadua’s first job, of course I will dress up”. One of the photos from that day captured his effervescent smile so well that it is being framed to be the photograph to remember him by. To mean as much to someone is not something I know how to put into words.I kept staring at my palm in the engulfing darkness of the cold Dutch night.Mohana met Dadua only after we got married. But she knew of him from our college days – till date, she recalls how awestruck she was hearing of Dadua’s technological prowess. Back in the early 2010s, we were all on the broadband bandwagon and it was liberating to have an omnipresent connection called “wifi”. It might have been considered a young man’s experiment in most households, but not in Lake Temple Road. Not only did Dadua have his own laptop, smartphone and wifi setup, he became quite famous among my friends for insisting to upgrade his poor BSNL network to a faster Airtel one! He honed new ideas for handicraft from the internet and I often got to see him trying new tools like a hot glue gun and coloured glue sticks, which he used to make desk items like pen holders.I kept staring at my palm in the engulfing darkness of the cold Dutch night.If you pass by Shib Mandir, you may be forgiven for not noticing the otherwise unremarkable building that stands at Lake Temple Road. To me though, it is a foundational pillar to who I was as a child and who I became as an adult, and Dadua is an integral part of that and I will forever miss him. I met Dadua for the last time on March 24, 2023. I am still grappling with the harsh reality that I will never see him again. What stays with me are his stories, his lifestyle, his teachings, and his appreciation for the arts. I recall him reciting the following passage often with glistening eyes. Today it holds a very special place as I cling to his memory.ফিরায়ে দিনু দ্বারের চাবি, রাখি না আর ঘরের দাবি— সবার আজি প্রসাদবাণী চাই॥ অনেক দিন ছিলাম প্রতিবেশী, দিয়েছি যত নিয়েছি তার বেশি। I kept staring at my palm in the engulfing darkness of the cold Dutch night." } , { "title" : "Exposing the page-view analytics of this site", "url" : "/blog/tech/2021/11/15/site-analytics/", "date" : "15 Nov 2021", "description" : "In this post, I expose the analytics of this site, mostly to convince myself that someone reads this (even if it’s my own private browser sessions)!" } , { "title" : "On building habits", "url" : "/blog/non-tech/2021/10/25/on-building-habits/", "date" : "25 Oct 2021", "description" : "During the last five years of my working life, I have come to realise that there are fewthings that pay off in the long run as much as the ability to form habits easily. Inretrospect, starting to do something like working out every other day, reading at aparticular time of day, preparing for teaching a lesson – all have benefited fromrepetitive incremental progress through habits. Here are three things that have helped mebuild habits. Anchoring: While building habits, it is easier to associate the new activity to anexisting habit that you’re used to. For example, if going out for a run is already partof your day, then adding a post-run task like having your pills is easier thanremembering to have it at 7 am. Once a habit becomes part of the day, it can then becomean anchor for another new habit. Planning: Part of building a habit is repetition, and for something to berepeatable, it should not change much. That is, chalk out a plan beforehand, maybe theprevious day (tweak it if required) but stick to it through thick and thin – takethe thinking or optionality out of the activity. If I am planning to run 5 km in themorning, the option of cutting the run short should not even be present. A more detailedplan, for example, a 1 km pre-run warm up and a post run cool down, takes the thinkingout of the picture and knowing it is obligatory even in those days that aretiring, makes build the habit. Reviewing: One of the best things a smart watch has helped me with, in so far asworkouts are considered, is a review of the last day/week’s activities. If I had beenable to do all of my workouts in the week, looking back and reviewing it is a greatsense of accomplishment, while not being able to do so is a reason to push harder in thenext day/week. In terms of general habit-building, such reviewing of past activities hashelped me make a conscious effort for those missed triggers, because as humans those arebound to happen.

Two major projects: A Lisp interpreter and a blog post tweet bot that I hope will publish this post Computer architecture, all the way from the hardware to the instruction execution cycleOne of the perks of being able to have the opportunity to teach the fundamentals is that I get to relearn these concepts from a very different perspective, all over again.

Imagine thinking from first principles and even questioning those first principles. When I was first exposed to the fundamentals, I didn’t know any better than to take things at their face value and that obviously left holes in my knowledge, not to mention all the things I didn’t even remember I had once learned.

I cannot lie that no matter how many IITians I meet, I will never stop being self-conscious and intimidated by them. The lingering thought here is that I will never be able to be as successful or technically proficient as someone who studied at a prestigious and highly regarded institute like an IIT. Upon introspection, I have come to the conclusion that Darwin and the theory of natural selection might just be able to explain what I am feeling and ultimately why IITians are a distinguished subset of engineers in India.The success of the IITs is not because of its teachers or research prowess, which is evident in the fact that the IITs never rank high in global University rankings. Any institute held in high regard by large enough number of people, will end up attracting the smartest minds. The invariant here is that most students in a country of India’s size want to study in the IITs. Because of the sheer competition for the very limited number of seats at the IITs, by virtue of the merit-based selection examinations (akin to natural selection in Darwin’s theory of evolution), only the smartest people end up in the IITs. If suddenly, by some divine intervention, all of Indian students stopped thinking of the IITs as the holy grail of undergraduate studies, then I would be very surprised if the best engineers in the country are still IITians. It is not the teachings at IIT that make great engineers, it is a direct correlation to the smartest people ending up in the IITs in the first place. Once a conglomerate of really smart people are formed at the IITs, there is no stopping, they practically shoot themselves into success. By passing the barrier to entry, the very few that get through, they have already proven to the world that they are better than the rest, what happens inside the gates of the IITs is immaterial.This influences the companies that are looking to recruit engineers as well. Since the institute is perceived highly by the common people, because of competition for the few seats and the merit-based selection exams, only the best people end up there, so the probability of recruiting smart people is much higher at the IITs, so more and more companies look to recruit at the IITs, causing more interest in the IITs among aspiring engineers. The feedback loop reinforces the superiority of the IITs. It doesn’t even have to be an IIT, anything that is perceived as “good” by enough people will eventually attract enough “good people” to actually make the thing “good”.In hindsight, there is perhaps no reason to be intimidated by people from the IITs or to think that one is not technically as proficient as someone from an IIT because not being from an IIT doesn’t necessarily demerit one. But it would be naive and remiss to think that those who have out-raced millions to get into the IITs are not among the distinguished subset of engineers in India." } , { "title" : "Pale blue dot: A Covid-19 perspective", "url" : "/blog/non-tech/2020/05/12/pale-blue-dot/", "date" : "12 May 2020", "description" : "In his famous book “The pale blue dot”, Carl Sagan wrote about our unremarkable position in the Universe as human beings.

As the spacecraft left our planetary neighborhood for the fringes of the solar system, NASA turned it around for one last look at our home planet.As the world plunges into the unthinkable crisis of Covid-19, it is hard to find hope and courage to dream of a better day. Everything we know and love, our way of life, has reached a point of existential crisis. While many of our livelihoods are affected, many others are paying the dearest price of having to lose their loved ones. Look again at that dot. That’s here. That’s home. That’s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,” every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there–on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.If our species reaches an end to life as we know it, what stories will we tell our children?

Your parents have told you this, your teachers keep telling you this and deep down, you either believe them and slog your way through the two final years of school, or if you are like me, don’t believe a word of what everyone else is saying and hope to wiggle your way into the adult world some way or another. The second approach — my approach — isn’t for the faint-hearted, and it carries with it a bucketful of enormous risks. I wouldn’t advise it to myself if I could travel back in time. But in an odd way, I am thankful for the way things turned out. The thing about taking risks is, if it pans out for you, the reward is the justification, but paradoxically, the promise of the same reward is not enough to risk it all. This is the story of such a journey: a teacher who was so good, he almost ruined my life.I was never the smartest student in class, and looking back, I perhaps wasn’t even trying to be one, in spite of my mother’s hopes and dreams. I had to be forced to sit down to study, and even if I was sitting down, I would rather daydream about the “Swat Kats” cartoon show or think about my Pokemon card collection while I was forced to fixate on reading the “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” or solve compound interest problems. I just didn’t get the point of studying anything. That was until class eight, when we were introduced to the subject of Computer Science.In the beginning, I didn’t really understand anything that was taught in class. Later, I realised, much of my disconnection from classwork was due to unmotivational teaching methods, but one could always argue against it. After all, there were still kids excelling subjects in the class with the same teaching methods. Anyway, the mystery that shrouded subjects like Mathematics and Chemistry, also cast its shadow on this new subject of “Computer Science”. For the longest time, I couldn’t figure out why there were no computers used in the class of “Computer Science”. After months of getting twos and threes out of fifty in class tests, my father, in a desperate attempt to make something positive out of my schoolwork, started teaching me Computer Science, recalling his early days of programming as a Physics student.Over the next six months, he showed me how to express logic in a way a computer would understand. It was then that it dawned on me that this seemingly tasteless subject is actually very interesting, because here and here alone, I could create something out of nothing. I found solace in it from the dry nature of the rest of my coursework. Being able to apply lessons to a whole different problem had gotten me very excited. What the confines of the classroom and limits of textbooks could not contain, the promise of embarking on an adventurous quest certainly captured the interest of my non-studious mind. I felt the first sense of vastness of the subject, like a sailor at sea and in the vastness, a sense of exploration, when my father would ask me to write a computer program that I had never even thought a computer could do, like talking to a human being and having a back and forth conversation. Though it was the same conversation every time, to my young sailor mind, which never knew nothing outside of questions at the end of chapters, this was nothing short of Vasco da Gama’s voyage to the East. As I look back now, my most rewarding failure was perhaps that class test I scored two out of fifty, because of which my father took me under his tutelage. The rest, as they say, was supposed to be history.But life went on. From class eight to class twelve, I found my love for computer programming, but I still had to study other subjects. Growing up, especially during those formative teenage years, it is extremely difficult to distinguish between influence and interest, and I got caught in the middle of it. In class eleven, we had Mr Andrews as our English teacher. He was unorthodox in his teaching methods and focused on not just explaining the piece we were supposed to be taught, but also the state of the mind of the author or poet and the thought process that led him/her to write the piece. In a sense, this was similar to the thrill of solving problems through computer programming. I remember this one section from “Macbeth” where Banquo talks about how “instruments of darkness” betray us in times of “deepest consequence”. While it seemed like just another English essay, Mr Andrews’ explanation of how Shakespeare wanted to portray the internal struggle and mental state of a man who is about to commit treason took me to a whole new dimension. This became even more captivating to me in times when he would ask us to go home and write a “critical appreciation” of a piece. One such sultry pensieve summer evening, critiquing Shakespeare, Yeates and Wordsworth, I decided to take up English as my subject in college. Little did I know that I was about to make the biggest blunder in my life. As poignant as it can be, in the words of Shakespeare, “violent delights have violent ends. The sweetest honey is loathsome in its own deliciousness. And in the taste, destroys the appetite.”I had been told that taking up language studies in college was a humbling and character-building experience, as one would step into the shoes of bards and authors, and as if through the moulding effect of fire, become like the glass that provides the reflection of society through literature. However, within a month of going to English honours classes in college, I started feeling the disconnection from what I had been promised by the likes of teachers like Mr Andrews and what it really meant to study English as a subject. During the breaks between classes, I would meet my friends from the Computer Science department. Hearing them talk about the courses they were taking reminded me of the thrill I felt as a child conquering the uncharted waters like Vasco da Gama. Those breaks between classes made me hear a voice that wouldn’t whispering inside me, telling me that I belonged there.After a long battle convincing the Dean and the Vice-Principal, I was permitted to change my stream from Humanities to Science, and on to familiar ground of Computer Science. And I never looked back since. Finally, I was finally home.My quest has taken me from the careless student, to the joyful explorer to the easily-influenced teenager to the college student who could finally sit down and enjoy a subject in its most enthralling form as well as its most unforgiving form. Unlike many people, I was extremely lucky in finding a subject I truly loved. If I have any advice to give to young students, it is that finding one’s calling is as important as not being led to believe someone else’s love for something as one’s own. A teacher can be a guide in helping you find your calling or alienate you from your calling or project their calling onto you. It’s up to you to distinguish between the three and find your true calling, without which you might end up taking the road to perdition in the rat race to a “good career”." } , { "title" : "The fairy tale of life", "url" : "/blog/non-tech/2012/11/12/the-fairy-tale-of-life/", "date" : "12 Nov 2012", "description" : "“Heaven’s morning breaks and earth’s vain shadows flee;In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.”- Henry Francis LyteMimi (my mother’s sister)’s health had been silently deteriorating from inside during the last two months. Medical treatment came with her daily bread all throughout her life, and probably that’s why I had initially not been much alarmed by her failing health as narrated by my mother, who had been her guide through thick and thin, especially after her trip to Thailand. But none of us, not even she herself, expected it to end all when it did. A dear one’s death, of course is never easy to accept. When her lifeless body was brought home for everyone to pay their respects, I felt a lump in my throat, but I knew that now she rests beneath the heavenly skies.I tried writing about her life because I trust her life deserves to be told but I soon gathered that the profundity of the agony that was her life cannot be appreciated nor valued by simple narration. So I look at it from a different angle – investigating how altered her life and everyone’s around her would be if she was not so ill fated to have been a victim of immuno-suppressive disease xeroderma pigmentosum – the lifelong battle to which she finally had to succumb to.I have analysed many people, including my father, who had a rich, memorable childhood with cousins from the paternal as well as the maternal side. If the heavens were sympathetic enough to grant Mimi a ‘normal’ life, she might have had her own family with a husband, children and her own self-sustaining life and I would probably have a few cousins of my own. Maybe one of them would also share my passion for computer science and we could share ideas just like my father and mother do with their cousins. Bhaiphota and Bijoya Dashami reunions would be days of excitement, fun and frolic and the house would be full of people spreading enjoyment – it would be as charming as flowers blooming on a country churchyard. Children running around, mother and Mimi engaged in organising the Bijoya dinner party and my father and Mesho (as Mimi’s husband would be called) sitting at the drawing room sofa discussing matters that we young people consider boring is a most common sight at every mamabari – but not mine.I have seen my Thamma going often to her brothers’ and sisters’ places to spend an evening, a day or sometimes even a week just for a change of air. Picturing my mother going to my Mesho’s house to spend a day or two, or to help Mimi shop for the Pujo, or help her decide the wedding dress for Mimi’s eldest daughter is what I would pray to God for my mother because just like any other sibling, she deserves such joys. My mother and Mimi might also together have arranged a trip for my grandparents to Thailand, instead of just my mother. Mimi, if her health had permitted, could’ve turned out to be a professor of Geography, or might have worked at a corporate office and the two sisters could collaborate and share their work experiences with each other – as I have noticed my father does with his siblings. But that was what one can have hoped – the truth is far from it.Having all children successful in their own lives, managing their own family, and living happily is what every parent wants to see. I remember Dadu had said, after my uncle got married and settled down, that he had nothing else to worry about in his life. Seeing the realisation of the well wishes of a parent for the eldest child was never to be so for my grandparents. Seeing the excitement that we as children spark in my grandparents’ faces, I can hardly envision how fulfilling it would make them feel to have four or five grandchildren from both their daughters gather around and listen to the stories of mythical creatures and scientific discoveries of the past that they told me when I was a child. My grandfather would have more grandchildren to distribute the priceless fruits of his rooftop garden while my grandmother would probably have a granddaughter to teach how to wear a saree and how to look like a princess. If all of that were to happen, Dadua and Dida would, like Dadu, have nothing else to worry about for the rest of their lives.The most common things one associates life with – a job, professional life, marriage, family and children of one’s own – were way out of reach for her. If the stars hadn’t given her such a painful life, then like my mother, even she would have, above all, her own wing of the family tree. Maybe in her college days, she might even have met her soul mate, who she would later marry and have a love story to tell her grandchildren! She might also have perfected her praiseworthy skills in embroidery to run a small scale successful business. In short, she would have a world of her own.Words are incapable to describe how spectacularly different Mimi’s life would be if her well-being was guaranteed. Although she survived for 48 years, much unlike the doctors’ predictions when she was first diagnosed with the disease, it deprived her of the basic joys of life. Apart from the rewards of an average life, she would also be happily ignorant of a disease called Xeroderma Pigmentosa and blissfully unfamiliar with eye institutes like the L. V. Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad that one would go to for treating tumours in eyes and be relieved of the excruciating pain that is accompanied.Imagination, once unleashed, is in its nature to run beyond the boundaries of reality. Mimi’s fate was such that at the age two years, the stars decided that she would be deprived of the things one would expect to have in life and was left alone, diseased, with a crippled vision. Instead of children, she had medicines – steroids for her eyes that would have to be applied every fifteen minutes all throughout the day and night like a new born baby needs attention all through the day; instead of her own family, she had appointments with doctors; in place of a job, she had corneal grafting in her eyes in multiple occasions; instead of her own wedding, she missed some of her younger sister’s wedding ceremonies because of the critical condition of her eyes. Xeroderma pigmentosum is said to occur in one individual for every 250,000 and on top of that, it is roughly six times more common in Japanese people than in other groups. It has been said with truth that fate is never without a sense of irony.What I have illustrated here is not the life of a queen, but one that every common man lives and takes for granted. Even an ordinary life was too good to be true for her, like a fairy tale – one she might only dream of, but never make real. But even if we do not consider the fruits of normal life, she had to fight for the very things that we take for granted from birth – her eyesight became steadily weaker year after year. There was a time when she exclaimed with joy that she could make out if there was a car a few feet ahead of her and she considered that day to be lucky to have even that little vision. Because the battle that she had to put up with all through her life, she understood the sick and the needy better than anyone else I know. She had always put her best foot forward to help those who needed her even before they could call for help – be it my brother while having a minor surgery, or the poor children of Kathamrita Shangha who were cold and needed warm clothes in winter – she herself went and cared however she could, often transcending her own physical limitations. Sometimes the little things that one do make one great. Her memory will live on through us and her story deserves to be told and listened. But more than that, there’s a lot to learn from her that the Divine Providence taught her – “to give and not to count the cost, to fight and not to heed the wounds, to toil and not to seek for rest, to labour and not to ask for reward”.I have seen so many people who have so much to be happy about but still mourn the smallest of things that they couldn’t have. The struggle that she knew life to be from the tender age of two years is an example how one who had almost nothing in her life could still be content with it. All her life, in spite of the pain she had a firm belief in the Almighty. Although she was put through what seems almost too much, she never lost her faith, and it was that faith that carried her forward and gave her the will to fight and the zeal to survive. I am left in utter amazement and respect for her as my grandmother narrates how painful her childhood, adolescence and adulthood were. All along, her constant companion was pain. I can vividly recall the last few days of her life in the ICU – the strong odour of antibiotics, medicines and disinfectants or the smell of death as I now call it, made me dizzy but she fought on, with determination in her spirit and to the daze of the doctors, till her last breath for she was born into a world to fight, struggle and return triumphant like the charge of the Light Brigade in the battle of Balaclava in 1854. I feel her life was not a journey, it was a test of her endurance – a test by God Himself to see how long before she breaks – and she never did, she never gave up – not even on her deathbed.“When can their glory fade?O the wild charge they made!All the world wonder’d.”- Lord Alfred Tennyson" } , { "title" : "A different kind of nostalgia", "url" : "/blog/non-tech/2012/10/11/a-different-kind-of-nostalgia/", "date" : "11 Oct 2012", "description" : "“Whoever loved that loved not at first sight?”- William ShakespeareI must have been eight or nine when my parents took me and my brother for a trip to the northern hills. As far as I can recall, we were a lively family group of nine. The trip was centred on Sikkim. When my mother first told me of the trip to the hills, I had pictured myself with a ruck sack and climbing up the rocks of the mountains. Unfortunately the reality didn’t remotely resemble that. In its place, to my utter dissatisfaction, I had to endure five-hour rides in ancient land rovers every day from one hill station to another. I didn’t particularly enjoy that.Nothing in that trip was exceptional. Yes, a group of fun-loving folk is always much of a pleasure to be a part of even if you are an introvert but apart from the merry and the mirth that my family always brings to me, nothing in that portion of the trip was so fulfilling that I would write about twelve years later. To my wonder, the part of the tour that I least expected from became what I remember that trip by, even today. Life surprises us from where we least expect it to – one might call that divine comedy. As per plan, my parents, my brother and I extended our trip by a few more days after the rest of the group had gone back to Kolkata. The four of us yet again embarked on another of those long jeep-rides to Darjeeling. Quite naturally I didn’t think Darjeeling, which I had first heard of only a few months back, would be any different from the places we’d already been to. Never had I been so pleased to have been proven wrong.On our way to Darjeeling, I had slept off in the first half of the journey so can’t recollect much. However, I do remember that after travelling quite a large section of the journey, my father started telling us how Darjeeling was not just another tourist destination for him. I listened intently and got deeply absorbed into everything he was saying. Much too soon, as it seemed, the driver called to me as we were nearing a bend, pointing his index finger straight at the hills at a distance. I could see a town sitting on the ridges of the gorgeous hills afar, like a child sleeping quietly on her mother’s lap. “Do you see that?” he said to me, “That is Darjeeling”. Everything about that trip changed that instant.Every time I tell the story of why Darjeeling is special, for some very peculiar reason, I refer to it in first person, though I shouldn’t, technically, as it was all about long before I was born. I learned, for the first time, that we once lived there. That is, when my grandfather was of my age, the family lived in Darjeeling in a moderately sized middle-class house known as ‘Senabash’, meaning home to the Sen Family. The name itself felt enchanting to my ears. Later on in the tour, we had visited the ruins of the still standing storm-wrecked Senabash.Senabash is located at Ghoom, the station before Darjeeling railway station and isn’t very far from the town centre of Darjeeling. As the story goes, the members of the then joint Sen Family used to run their own indigenous businesses like a dairy called ‘Kanchan Dairy’, which was highly reputed among the people of the town for its quality, a poultry farm, and a piggery among others. My grandfather’s uncle (passionately called ‘Naw-kaka’), who became the head of the house after the demise of my great grandfather, was a believer in Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray’s ideals of Bengalis becoming entrepreneurs. When there was no one to maintain the family businesses, under his able leadership, it flourished to newer heights. But, with drift of the rural population slowly shifting towards the urban areas after independence, the flow also caught our family. Soon, the young generation in the family were drawn to more economically promising lands like Kolkata and government jobs with their guaranteed salary at the end of the month seemed to be an easier livelihood. But the very thought of living in the hills of Darjeeling with our own family, self-sustaining small scale businesses left me in wonder of how beautifully simple life could be – every member works in their own way throughout the day from early in the morning and rejoice in the unadorned joy of being together in the evening. The fast moving urban lifestyle takes the living out of life.The wooden house of Senabash was where my grandfather had grown up and my father, too, had spent a portion of his childhood there. The weather in Darjeeling is often very damp and one has to befriend the rain if one is to survive in a hill station like Darjeeling. Indeed that is why there was a room dedicated for umbrellas at Senabash! The other room that I have often heard of is Naw-kaka’s room. It is said that also my grandfather, the eldest of his brothers and sisters, feared to tread when he was at meditation. Respect sometimes is mistaken for fear. On the table in Naw-kaka’s room one would always find a bronze Buddha, as I am told. His sturdy belief in the Buddha (as evident from his daily meditation sessions) has reflected on my father –he, too, keeps a metallic Buddha at his study. As I have never had the pleasure to have entered it, Senabash is a palace of dreams. Like many a child, I had the habit of weaving images of what I heard as stories and from what I heard about our association with Darjeeling, I couldn’t wait to visit Senabash. Those images still take me back to past that I was not a part of but somehow I feel I belong there. Anyway, we contacted my father’s uncle (also called ‘Mejo-kaka’) who at that time still lived at a house next to Senabash and finally visited the ancestral home. Standing in front of it, the depth of its history made me feel very trivial in the sands of time, and also at the same time, a part of something great. There were two V-shaped diverging small flights of stairs leading to the front porch of the house. I found out that throughout its history, the members of the extended Sen Family would come from different parts of the country to Senabash for a family reunion once or twice a year. It was a time of immense festivity at Senabash, as my father recalls, with everyone having so much to share and even more to catch up with. On that same V-shaped stairs, on such reunions, typical family photographs would be taken each time, which became a tradition. As we stood there before what was left of Senabash, we too abided by that tradition and had a group photo in that exact same arrangement as it would be during the glorious days of Senabash. It was as if I could hear voices from inside the house and visualise the revelry of getting together, as we stood there. To a passer-by, it would be just the ruins of an old house but for me it was materialisation of our past and everything I heard and imagined about Senabash. I could stand there and revere it all day.Mejo-kaka’s house overlooked the picturesque Batasia loop where the toy train would take a round in a loop and return back. The toy train is the pride of Darjeeling. It was a sight to behold. The view from hill resplendent as it was, it was not the most famous view of Batasia loop – what I saw was a foggy view of the faintly visible toy train making the loop. The occasional wooing sound of the whistle of the toy train ruptured the silence of the hills as the train broke through a wall of fog. Every time the whistling stopped, silence descended on the hills like night falls on a desert after a hot afternoon. It was reverence – the sight, the sound and the silence. The reason it is so distinctive is because the atmosphere itself was very typically Darjeeling – misty, moist and mysteriously amazing. My father every so often tells us that Batasia loop was far more splendid when he was of my age and the beautification has robbed it of its natural beauty. In spite of that, it was a spectacle I recall often in my mind and it always brings a smile to my face – it is my host of golden daffodils:“For oft, when on my couch I lieIn vacant or in pensive mood,They flash upon that inward eye,Which is the bliss of solitude”– William WordsworthFrom the bond with Darjeeling that I cherish, to the walks along the undulating roads of the town and the flat paradise of the mall, from Keventer’s to Glenary’s, from the Darjeeling railway station to the Ghoom monastery – everything in Darjeeling has attached with it fondness, love and emotion. After that trip, I had been to Darjeeling about six times and every time I reach the queen of the hills, I don’t want to come back. It so happened that on one such trip to Darjeeling, due to terrible weather conditions, we couldn’t leave on the day we had to. And that was a godsend for me. I prayed that it would rain like that for the next few days too – unfortunately that didn’t happen!The term nostalgia describes a sentimental longing for the past, typically for a period or place with happy personal associations. But for me, although I do not have any factual personal associations, the heritage of Senabash and every story I heard of it has helped bridge the divide between what is real and what is felt only in the mind. Every time I think about Senabash, I feel that even I am a part of its legacy – or rather it is a part of me.It might be a cliché to say so but from the first moment I saw Darjeeling, I fell in love with her. For me, coming to Darjeeling is not a tour to the northern hills – it is homecoming." } , { "title" : "For the love of our planet", "url" : "/blog/non-tech/2011/11/07/for-the-love-of-our-planet/", "date" : "07 Nov 2011", "description" : "“The Earth we share is not just a rock tossed through space, but a living, nurturing being. She cares for us; she deserves our care in return.”-Michael JacksonThree score and three years ago our forefathers fought against the British and drove them out of the country. A few years before that, almost the entire plunged itself into the most horrific war in the history of man. In and after 1914, the world witnessed yet another world war. From all the wars and battles fought, one thing is certain-that we can unite ourselves when the cause is dear. Today, we face more intense circumstances-a situation which demands our attention as well as our united support. We face a global challenge today-a crisis. The gradual degradation requires our unity more than anything in the past because it has the potential to make us homeless; by ‘home’ I mean our only home, our Planet Earth.Most people do not find environmental education classes and lectures regarding the planet interesting nor do they think it is important. But what they do not see is that this subject is not merely academically significant. The chapters in books about this subject are not only for examinations, because what is happening out there is real and it is happening now. This is not science fiction, this is as real as it can get. It’s not just a global warning, the change is occurring and we must act now to save ourselves. We do not want to tell our children that “we had our choice, we chose not to act”. Water crisis, flash floods, global warming, deforestation, loss of habitat, droughts, waste disposal problems, pollution… the list is endless. The environment needs our combined efforts for we have done a few things to degrade its health. It is time for is to come together once again, to fight again-not from tyranny oppression or persecution, but for ourselves, for our children, for our home. Let’s show the world that we will not give up without a fight, we will not stop trying, we will give our all and all. All this we can do all this we must do. “There comes a time when we hear a certain call, when the world must come together as one. We can’t go on pretending day by day that some one somewhere will soon make a change. We are all a part of God’s great big family and the truth, you know, love is all we need. We are the world, we are the children, and we are the ones who make a brighter day so let’s start giving. There’s a choice we’re making we’re saving our own lives. It’s true we’ll make a better day, just you and me” SMS. Talk. Blog. Browse. Debate. Speak. Let’s create awareness and tell all those who have been turning a blind eye to this global crisis that, we must do something and we must do it now. We have to act now so that a time does not come when we are forced to say “it’s too late now”. It’s not easy, but it is not difficult because we have done the impossible and I can say with certainty that if the human race comes together as one, we can do anything at all. Writing in newsletters, drawing posters, speaking up, making themselves heard-every bit helps. We do not want to become homeless. Each and every one of us can do something in our own way, and be no less than ‘Captain Planet’. Today let us speak up and heal the world." } , { "title" : "Beauty", "url" : "/blog/non-tech/2010/06/10/beauty/", "date" : "10 Jun 2010", "description" : "Since the ancient days, when life was simple and meaningful, the human body has been termed as the ‘Temple of the Living God’. As we head towards what we call, with pride, our common future, we sometimes forget the basic things in life-the things that make our life special and not merely a database. Joy, ecstasy, bliss, and most importantly love makes our life beautiful. This beauty is rapidly fading in this world and we are slowly becoming nothing more than machines that neither feel anything nor can perceive any emotion. The glory of this beauty is love and life is the manifestation of God’s artistic nature. The beauty of life and everything created by God should not fade with time. If it does, as it is now, owing partly to the inhuman atrocities of the corporate world, then we are heading for another dark era. It is this beauty that blessed people like the Buddha, Swami Vivekananda and Mahavir wanted us to see and find out just as they had figured out that it leads to divinity and true joy to the soul. Eminent authors like Paulo Coelho, Mitch Albom and Robin Sharma has stressed on this and has rightfully done so. The beauty of life and its manifestation is truly the cause that the human body can be referred to as the ‘Temple of the Living God’.It is the small things in life, that seem so trivial, that make life so beautiful and special. The Splendor of life is a force that drives us all, whether we can feel it or not. It is a force that can be felt at all times-we just have to know how to recognize it. It is this force that makes us believe even in the darkest of times, that we can still light the candle of hope and we refuse to give up. This strength comes straight from God. In our hour of darkness, God will never fail to come to us and whisper words of wisdom to us to keep going on. The power of our will and refusal to ever lose hope is one of the main aspects of beauty that adorns us. It is the beauty of life that gives us the strength to fight for right against might.Beauty is not at all an interface to hide from us the real truth, as it is nowadays thought of as, but something much greater. The exquisiteness of life is not what appeals to our eyes but what appeals to our hearts. And it is this aspect of the loveliness that is associated with life that makes us one with the rest of God’s creations. This Magnificence makes us a part of the ‘Soul of the Universe’ as we were destined to be. In it lies true happiness. It is this gorgeousness of life that makes solitude pleasant and appealing to the heart and not painful as it seems to people who refuse to surrender to this eternal beauty. Unfortunately people of this century have become so ambitious and tend to seem so busy that they hate to think about life and its driving force and thus life has ceased to be simple and meaningful. Thinking of these things reminds me of the song ‘Coming back to Life’-it is perfectly suitable for today’s SMS generation. We are so busy with our lives that we do not find the time to stop by, look and reflect at our own life which means so much to us, and say to ourselves, “Is this all I want? Is there something missing?” Mitch Albom correctly says that those who know themselves dying are alien to the living. It is because once we know that our time on earth is limited and our days are numbered, we start looking at life in a totally different way. It is at this time that we see how beautiful life is and how meaningless running after things like money and fame are.This reminds me of an incident that happened a couple of days back right in front of my eyes. The day was bright and it was the afternoon when I was coming home after school. I saw a typical aged Bengali walking slowly down the same footpath as me clad in white ‘dhoti’ and ‘Punjabi’ with an umbrella. Most people were storming past this old gentleman without even noticing him. Then all of a sudden, a black Toyota Corolla stooped near the footpath and from it came out a man of not more than thirty five wearing a grey expensive looking suit. By the looks of the man, I could tell that he was quite well off. And to my utter surprise, the young man went to the old man, stooped down on the ground and this led to his pants kissing the road and shoes getting unnatural folds. What he did was ‘Pranam’. It is a gesture and an act of respect in the Bengali culture that a young man does meet an old man after a long time. The act that he did regardless of his clothes and the people around him really depicts how beautiful a true honest and grateful heart can be. That day I was seriously moved by seeing this incident. That made me believe strongly in the saying that if we are true to ourselves and do what we think is right, then we can live up to the expectation of being the ‘Temple of the living God’.On our deathbed, we would never wish that we spent more time in our office. In the end, social status, money, fame nothing actually means to us. What really matters is how we could live our life by loving and letting love come in. And that is the beauty of life and reason for our existence." } , { "title" : "The Angel and the Devil", "url" : "/blog/non-tech/2010/05/09/the-angel-and-the-devil/", "date" : "09 May 2010", "description" : "The mind is a dangerous place. It can make a hell of a difference. Ironically, it is not far from the truth. It is in the nature of humans that when we get the power we desired, we do not know what to do with that. It is then that we start doing wrong things.We were once humans. Looking at the violence, carnage, slaughter and mayhem caused by us today, we can hardly relate ourselves to the primitive peaceful human beings. The human is swiftly fading in us. The classical belief about the Satan being in Hell and the gods in Heaven are just superstitions to me. I think that in each and every one of us lives the Devil and the Angel. The question is whom we allow to take control of us. It is the Devil or the evil spirit in us provokes us with great force to take revenge, be jealous, and resort to violence. The Angel, seemingly less strong in most cases, needs the support of the mind to manifest itself in us. In other words, we have to be courageous and be able to control and restrict ourselves from what we believe to be bad to let the Angel mark itself on us, which is absolutely not an easy thing to do. Most people are unable to exercise such sturdy control over their emotions and their minds and thus seeing the advantage, the Devil shows the easier path. But we rarely know then, that there is a difference between what is right and what is easy. That is what the Angel tries to tell us. What the Devil does is to win our confidence in helping us with trifle matters, and then betray us “in deepest consequence”. Thus, the devil manifests itself in more number of people than the Angel. Those possessed by the Devil are unfortunately more in number. Such people are not only a threat to the whole human race but the whole planet also owing to the latest weapons in wrong hands. We tend to forget that this planet, being a gift of God, is not only for us but also for every living organism on the face of the Earth.The evil spirit in us eventually takes control and prevents us from listening to our hearts and trying to fulfill our heart’s desire. It initially seems that we are doing what we want and that we are in sitting on the driving seat with his help. We also feel good and strong as we let the Devil slowly form a symbiotic relationship with us. These symbiotic relationships once bound are very hard to unbind. Slowly, this symbiotic relation turns one sided even without our knowing it. Then the Devil in us reveals its true colors and we become none but slaves to the Dark Lord residing in us. This is analogous to the classical belief that the devil will go to some damned soul and show that person a contract, which originally seems perfect and the person signing it feels that there is nothing he can lose by signing such a contract. But in the end he finds that by making the small mistake of signing a pact with the Devil, he has sold his soul to him and for him awaits Hell and eternal damnation. No amount of pleading will help in changing the facts because the one thing the Devil lacks completely is mercy.It is only our mind that is divided into the Devil and the Angel. There are a few ways in keeping away from the Devil. Firstly and most importantly it is love that can save us from our doom. Secondly if we are able to keep our minds occupied with good things, the Devil will not get a chance to implement its wrath. And lastly, we must never lose control of our minds. The mind is a dangerous place. It can make a heaven out of hell and a hell out of heaven." } , { "title" : "A school for life", "url" : "/blog/non-tech/2010/05/06/a-school-for-life/", "date" : "06 May 2010", "description" : "“Looking back on boyhood years, even unhappiness acquires a certain glow”-Ruskin BondAnd there it was, is and will always be standing magnificently in the middle of Park Street, with its head held high in the blue sky, with two words inscribed on its logo- ‘NIHIL ULTRA’.

Little did I know that I would be crying a great deal more when the time would come to finally say goodbye to my school days. It still seems as though it were only yesterday…Time flies. Nine years later, when I know that my school life will soon be a history, I wish I could live it all over again. Being a Xavarian is not only about going to school and coming back, but also about the feeling of being one with a tradition, a culture and 150-year-old heritage. There is a saying that we only appreciate the value of something when we feel that we are about to lose it forever. What I know I would miss the most is the unity, harmony and integrity among the students and the teachers because out there is a world divided-a world mainly of self centred people, who care only about their own benefits, a world from which we had been shielded from for so long. The world is so wild but we have our own paradise inside the grand yellow walls.Friends. How different life would be in the absence of school mates! The friends we make in school are friends for life because they have no personal interest in their personal gain as their love for us is unconditional and that is why when two Xavarians meet miles away from their home in some different country, they say to themselves, ‘I am not alone. Here I have my friend.’ In this world, true friends are the hardest things to find. I’m fortunate enough to say that Xavier’s has given me a lot more than just education. Apart from other great gifts, it has given me life-long companions, who are ‘men for others’. Even in spite of the sad empty feeling of missing our school, we find a new strength as we realise that a brotherhood of great ‘men for others’ is always behind us supporting, helping and being there when we need anything. Just then, when we look back on our lovely school building, we can only think of the two most sacred words we have learnt in school-‘NIHIL ULTRA’. And so, we step into the outside world with courage in our hearts and dreams in our eyes.Wherever we go and whatever we do in life, we always carry with ourselves the school badge-but this badge is not a shining piece of metal but is an invisible etching on our inner selves. It can’t be seen, but is always there with two words engraved clearly on it-‘NIHIL ULTRA’. Nothing Beyond.“Let’s all give a lusty cheer-HURRAY! For our school so dear.”" } , { "title" : "What remains", "url" : "/blog/non-tech/2009/11/16/what-remains/", "date" : "16 Nov 2009", "description" : "Dadu passed away on the 27th of December, 2008, and after that, things were never the same. Just after he left us forever, most of us couldn’t feel what had actually happened. We all felt sad, but we never really missed him nor could we believe what had happened owing mainly to the fact that just after someone passes away, there are many ceremonies in the Hindu culture that keeps one from really understanding the gravity of the situation. Many people came and went over the next 11 days. That made us feel somewhat better and we were as if in a Dream world in which Dadu had just left us for a while and we never in actual fact left us forever. But it was a dream world-a dream that we were experiencing being wide awake. It was because the truth was too hard to believe. That includes all of us. Lately, I have been feeling differently. Things have changed over the past few days and they changed drastically from the 6th of January, when Dadu’s last rites were held. Of late, I have been feeling the way I had never felt before. It’s like a ‘zahir’ in Arabic. It literally means visible present and unble to go unnoticed. It is someone or something which gradually occupies our mind and we can think of nothing else. Many a times, it so happened that something very ordinary caused me to remember the once-living legend among us, Dadu. And to my surprise, it feels much stronger than anything I’ve ever felt. The truth is I’ve never undergone such strong remembrances.Once every week I go to my English tuition early in the morning. Sometimes in the past few months (when Dadu went for late morning walks) I’d meet with Dadu near the BD market and sometimes he would not even notice me and pass me on a Rickshaw or walk slowly on his return on the other side of the road and I would decide to not look behind at dadu but continue listening to my portable music player which is usually set at a very loud volume. And some times he’d look at me and smile-that smile I can never forget. At those very moments I never realized that how nostalgic the memory of such an unimportant part of the day can turn out to be. It’s as if I can still see him smiling like that when I close my eyes. That old habit of meeting dadu in an unexpected place has not yet left me. Even now when I pass the BD market and I see a man wearing a black coat, a pair of black trousers and a dark blue muffler carrying a polythene, filled with the day’s shopping, in his hand, the first instincts tell me innocently that it’s dadu. Soon I realize that he’s a not present in this sinned earth anymore. This has happened more than three times as of now and every time it happens, my eyes start to glisten and just then I want to control myself because I think that it funny and I don’t want to be laughed at. The funny thing is that my eyes did not get watery even the day dadu passed away. The little moments that I had spent with dadu, mean more to me very much now that they are no longer possible to live again. Of all things it is only memory that remains.I had often had a small fall out between baba and ma about going to meet dadu and pamma at eight sharp in the evening. I had always been of the view that I don’t want to go there and waste my time while I can stay and utilise it doing something else. I used to go there and meet them after my exams had been over. Now I realise how wrong I was when I used to think that it was a waste of time. Those very meetings were like a reunion. What I would not do just to hear dadu say, “Oh! Mourjo has come today!!!” Just that smile on his face would make my day. In my mind’s eye I can still see him sitting on the great red chair (which I have been seeing from times immemorial), looking at the TV and having an orange with the seeds on the bed nearby. Honestly speaking (I know it is hard for anyone to believe but it is the truth), I miss those days now that they are gone forever. This proves the truth in the saying ‘We don’t mind them as long as we have them’.I used to play football regularly in the park just opposite to our house. In many bright sunny afternoons, I’d spot dadu sitting on the balcony and looking at us playing. I’d usually be too involved in the game to look up and smile. But dadu never failed to stop looking at us and whenever our eyes met, he’d smile at me-that same warm and soothing smile that came directly from the heart and out of the love that he had for all of us. It was spontaneous which made it so special. Some put on a forced smile on their faces just to make us feel that they loved us-that is a category of humans of which dadu was never a part. I am very proud to say that I am blessed enough to be the grandson of this great yet a simple man. The same nostalgic feeling surfaces when I take a walk down the old green verge from where one can see the place where dadu used to watch us play from. It may seem very stupid but as I walk all alone, I keep thinking about dadu and it again causes my eyes to moisten until I control myself and move on. The experience is so hearty that now and then, I’d make a million excuses to ma for going out and just taking a walk down that green verge which also proves to be a walk down the memory lane. Even while returning from some of my tuitions I take that walk and it my way to come in touch with dadu, who is not present anywhere around us but present everywhere surrounding us.Everyone is there, yet it seems that no one is there. I can faintly still remember those days when I’d be visiting CE 81 as a child of eight years. At that time we used to live in Burdwan and baba was the district magistrate there. We used to arrive in the late mornings. I’d sit down to eat lunch with my brother and ma on each side. Dadu would be sitting in his original place. And he would be asking me how I managed to have rice without dal as it was very dry. These small moments bring me joy that big things could never bring. And later in the day, I’d sometimes go out with Dadu for an evening walk in the same green verge, which is so full of memories, when ma would be in the college and after along walk, he’d tell me to trace our way back. I’d make arbitrary turns until almost all hopes of returning home would seem to have been lost, when Dadu would come and hold my hand and tell me, “Come, let me show you the way”. In the next morning, I’d be sitting on dadu’s lap. Dadu would be feeding me boiled eggs with a spoon and that used to be a very special moment for me. And as time goes by, I’ll always be there with you in the sunny morning eating with you, Dadu. My memory plays the same old song of nostalgia.All that remains are these memories with a few others that give me the pleasure of enjoying the company of Dadu even in his absence. I hope that time heals the pain but does not erase these memories as they give my life a new meaning every time I perceive them. Time mostly succeeds in fading these portraits I create with the everlasting paint called reminiscence but it will not be so this time. And I am sure that I can call myself the luckiest grandson on this Earth. May God bless his soul grant his resting in peace." } , { "title" : "A tribute", "url" : "/blog/non-tech/2009/01/04/a-tribute/", "date" : "04 Jan 2009", "description" : "“OK, I’ll find and give you the necessary medicine that’ll make you fit to go to the fair today…”he said to my grandma on Christmas Day when we sat down to discuss the program for the day. Even in the last few days allotted to him by God on this earth, he had never failed to take care of all those who needed his help. It is sad that nobody bothers to think about or rather thank God for the things one gets for granted in one’s everyday life and it is only when something disappears that we realize how useful it was to us or how dependent we were on it. My grandfather or more affectionately ‘dadu’ passed away two days later on 27th December, 2008 at 2:30pm. It is very depressing to find that all the great things he did in his life can only be appreciated once his tenure of life was over which includes what I’m writing right now.I’ve known many people over the years and I’ve known many eminent people also. But the more I think of dadu, the more I find myself asking the question of is it better to be talented and skillful or is it superior to be a good man. Though born with many diversified talents, the best aspect in him was his being the true gentleman. I have seen only sixteen years and a half of his life and I can well say that not many people are as ‘good hearted’ and caring as he was. People who had known him for longer will agree with me. Why he was a man of honor is too tough a question to answer. In all those years I had known him, I can never recall a time when he spoke badly of someone or lied to someone. Realizing the fact that there are other people who have known him for a much longer period, I had talked to some of them. And I was convinced that I was not wrong. Even at this age when I’m still young I could not do what he did for about eighty-four years that is maintaining his being a true gentleman and abiding by it all the time. I’ve had my share of mistakes but I have never been able to be nor have I seen anyone being half the man he was. It is perhaps for these reasons or more accurately virtues that he died most peacefully in his sleep. I recall a small incident in this perspective. It was just before the Durga Puja in one of the past few years. Baba was asking dadu what he would prefer to be a gift for that year’s puja. All dadu wanted was a very simple ‘lungi’. Most of us look forward to this time of the period because of the gifts that one would get or the ‘more-in-fashion’ clothes that one would be able to wear. I can only think of him who would want something so simple in such a great festive occasion. How many people living today can be so content with what he already has and not want more? All of us want something or the other at every point of time myself being the biggest example. Never in his life did he want anything from anyone. Dadu was out of the ordinary. And seeing all the qualities in him I do not think I’ll give it a second thought in calling him divine. God is kind to those who spread His word not only by preaching but also by exhibiting the properties that He would want to see in every man. It truly is an “end of an era” according to baba. But I think it was more like an end of a legend. “He died a happy man” said baba once he came home from the cremation ground on the 27th day in December 2008, which proved to be a terribly sad day in the history of the Sen Family.If tears could bring him back, I’d then definitely let my emotions take shape and start crying right away. But that won’t do any good. What has taken place cannot be altered. I do not believe in rituals after death nor do I believe in crying over spilt milk. But I do get amazed when I really sit down and think of how great yet simple a man can be when I think of him. He was perhaps the simplest person I’d ever meet. He was simply the best.“Well I’m glad that you did all the errands you were entrusted with and spontaneously went to have dadu’s photos bound…”whispered baba on the night of 28th of December. “Would I not do this bit for dadu?” I thought to myself and I imagined it to be a sarcastic smile on my mind’s face and I asked myself that was that all I could do for him after all the things he did for this family starting from building the house we live in. I couldn’t find an answer to my question. It was then for the first time that I thought of writing a tribute to this great man. We do not realize a Saint until he or she is dead. If I were to nominate a Saint, it would surely be our very own dadu. It’s not that I’m saying this now that he has passed away. I had said this to my brother long time back when he was a bit rude to him although dadu did not notice. I had told him that of all people dadu is one person whom I would never be rude to because I think that he was extraordinary. I added that I was sure that he would have his inevitable end to his life in a very peaceful manner. Those words I said from my heart and my brother will still agree that I had actually said that.What he left behind were only his deeds. From his life, we can learn a lot-“to be generous, to give and not to count the cost, to fight and not to heed the wounds, to toil and not to seek for rest, to labor and not to ask for any reward”.I do not think anyone ever found time to thank him for all that he had done. It is in the nature of great men to leave the world without seeing their works or merits being appreciated or being thanked for all that he or she had done all their life. He is not physically present but in us he lives-he lives within us, his descendants. I’d like to take this opportunity to thank him for all his deeds and worship him for the divine qualities in him on behalf all those who are reading this. And one thing I can guarantee right now is that we will never forget you, Dadu. As I kept thinking of Dadu, two lines of simple poetry flashed on my mind as if out of nowhere:I see skies of blue, red roses tooAnd I think to myself, “Where are you, Dadu?”Everything that has a beginning has an end. Although pishi had said “everyday that he lives is a bonus for him (dadu)”, it was still shocking for me to believe that he who was having ‘muri’ with us the day before would never move any of his muscles again. The more I think of it the more unbelievable it turns out to be. That day when I saw dadu’s dead body being moved, I was astounded as I never imagined I’d see this happen. It looked as if the body had never moved at all. It was for his loving nature that all those who experienced his love had come to see him for the last time within a very short notice and leaving behind all that which seemed to be important. “He had no enemies” Kaku remarked. And I absolutely believe it to be true. The day had come to an end with the passing away of a very dear husband, father, grandfather, relative and above all a man. We all pray that his soul finds peace." } , { "title" : "The essence of the Durga Puja", "url" : "/blog/non-tech/2008/07/07/the-essence-of-Durga-Puja/", "date" : "07 Jul 2008", "description" : "Since mediaeval times, the human body has been referred to as “the Temple of the living God”. Most people today do not even know the meaning of the phrase. In today’s professional world of competition, we tend to forget that we are humans and not merely databases. The humane element in us is fading in the sands of time as we move towards what we call our “common future”. It is hard to believe that we are so busy with our lives that we have no time to stand, stare at the world and ask ourselves, “Is this all I want? Is there something missing?” Most people today don’t even know the meaning of life.There are festivals in each community that brings people together and give us an opportunity to take a break from the world that seems so familiar to us but actually means nothing in the end. Someone once said, “On your deathbed, you will never wish that you spent more time in your office.” One such great festival is Durga Puja, and helps us in “coming back to life”.During this great festival of the East, people, especially Bengalis, come home from all over the world leaving behind all that they consider to be important and that is exactly what I look forward to every year in this festival. No song sounds as sweet in our ears as the home coming song as we head straight towards the place we, though may not show but always, feel that it is somewhere we belong when we are away. Somehow seeing such gatherings, I feel that that we are finally living up to the belief that in spite of what we do for our own interests, each of us is definitely “the Temple of the living God”. There are people who get to see each other only during this part of the year. The time when we all sit together to eat ‘bhog’ or when we together pray to God as we give ‘anjali’ is something that is too great for us to forget. It is a festival that brings us together even after years of separation and we see that even time, though sometimes called the best healer, can not stop the hearts of two old friends from beating in the same pattern when they finally reunite after pangs of separation. Owing to this world of races, we do not even get to meet our very close-to-our-house neighbors very often. No matter what our people say, during this festive season, we set aside all our petty differences, our selfish lives, our so-called aim in life, and our studies or work and at last get reflective on the human side of our life. It is true that out there, a world awaits all of us in which if we do not live up to the demands it puts forward to us, we simply will perish. But in the midst of such a world even, we can always find peace of mind and the best way to do so is to come home and meet our childhood friends, our relatives. That is what makes such a festival, a class of its own.The blend of this kind of an ambience and mentality with the sound of the ‘dhak’ and the lights make this festival close to our hearts. I have always and will always look forward to this festival because I feel that it is a part of me." } ]
