In retrospect, starting to do something like working out every other day, reading at a particular time of day, preparing for teaching a lesson – all have benefited from repetitive incremental progress through habits. Here are three things that have helped me build habits.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Anchoring</strong>: While building habits, it is easier to associate the new activity to an existing habit that you’re used to. For example, if going out for a run is already part of your day, then adding a post-run task like having your pills is easier than remembering to have it at 7 am. Once a habit becomes part of the day, it can then become an anchor for another new habit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Planning</strong>: Part of building a habit is repetition, and for something to be repeatable, it should not change much. That is, chalk out a plan beforehand, maybe the previous day (tweak it if required) but stick to it through thick and thin – take the thinking or optionality out of the activity. If I am planning to run 5 km in the morning, the option of cutting the run short should not even be present. A more detailed plan, for example, a 1 km pre-run warm up and a post run cool down, takes the thinking out of the picture and knowing it is obligatory even in those days that are tiring, makes build the habit.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Reviewing</strong>: One of the best things a smart watch has helped me with, in so far as workouts are considered, is a review of the last day/week’s activities. If I had been able to do all of my workouts in the week, looking back and reviewing it is a great sense of accomplishment, while not being able to do so is a reason to push harder in the next day/week. In terms of general habit-building, such reviewing of past activities has helped me make a conscious effort for those missed triggers, because as humans those are bound to happen.</p> </li> </ul> <p class="copy"> See anything to improve? <a href="https://github.com/mourjo/blog/tree/master/_posts/2021-10-20-on-building-habits.md">Edit this post</a>! </p> </article> <div class="giscus"></div> </main> <div class="footer"> <a href="/blog/">Blog</a> &#124; <a target="_blank" href="https://mourjo.me/cv.pdf">CV</a> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
