She cares for us; she deserves our care in return.‚Äù</em><br /> <em>-Michael Jackson</em></p> <p>Three score and three years ago our forefathers fought against the British and drove them out of the country. A few years before that, almost the entire plunged itself into the most horrific war in the history of man. In and after 1914, the world witnessed yet another world war. From all the wars and battles fought, one thing is certain-that we can unite ourselves when the cause is dear. Today, we face more intense circumstances-a situation which demands our attention as well as our united support. We face a global challenge today-a crisis. The gradual degradation requires our unity more than anything in the past because it has the potential to make us homeless; by ‚Äòhome‚Äô I mean our only home, our Planet Earth. Most people do not find environmental education classes and lectures regarding the planet interesting nor do they think it is important. But what they do not see is that this subject is not merely academically significant. The chapters in books about this subject are not only for examinations, because what is happening out there is real and it is happening now. This is not science fiction, this is as real as it can get. It‚Äôs not just a global warning, the change is occurring and we must act now to save ourselves. We do not want to tell our children that ‚Äúwe had our choice, we chose not to act‚Äù. Water crisis, flash floods, global warming, deforestation, loss of habitat, droughts, waste disposal problems, pollution‚Ä¶ the list is endless. The environment needs our combined efforts for we have done a few things to degrade its health. It is time for is to come together once again, to fight again-not from tyranny oppression or persecution, but for ourselves, for our children, for our home. Let‚Äôs show the world that we will not give up without a fight, we will not stop trying, we will give our all and all. All this we can do all this we must do. ‚ÄúThere comes a time when we hear a certain call, when the world must come together as one. We can‚Äôt go on pretending day by day that some one somewhere will soon make a change. We are all a part of God‚Äôs great big family and the truth, you know, love is all we need. We are the world, we are the children, and we are the ones who make a brighter day so let‚Äôs start giving. There‚Äôs a choice we‚Äôre making we‚Äôre saving our own lives. It‚Äôs true we‚Äôll make a better day, just you and me‚Äù SMS. Talk. Blog. Browse. Debate. Speak. Let‚Äôs create awareness and tell all those who have been turning a blind eye to this global crisis that, we must do something and we must do it now. We have to act now so that a time does not come when we are forced to say ‚Äúit‚Äôs too late now‚Äù. It‚Äôs not easy, but it is not difficult because we have done the impossible and I can say with certainty that if the human race comes together as one, we can do anything at all. Writing in newsletters, drawing posters, speaking up, making themselves heard-every bit helps. We do not want to become homeless. Each and every one of us can do something in our own way, and be no less than ‚ÄòCaptain Planet‚Äô. Today let us speak up and heal the world.</p> </article> <div class="giscus"></div> </main> <div class="footer"> <a href="/blog/">Blog</a> &#124; <a target="_blank" href="https://mourjo.me/cv.pdf">CV</a> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
