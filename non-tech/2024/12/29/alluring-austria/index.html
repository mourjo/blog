The last few months had been quite stressful at work, and I was very intently looking forward to a break. Any vacation would have been good but the trip to Austria was nothing short of alluring. To the point that I was inspired to pen down my thoughts during the trip.</p> <h1 id="december-22---arriving-in-austria">December 22 - Arriving in Austria</h1> <p>Amsterdam to Vienna was an hour-and-a-half long flight. Upon reaching, we quickly realised it was easier to book a taxi than pay for the airport express train. When we reached the captivating city of Vienna, we dropped our bags at the hotel and went for a walk around the city. Stumbling across the city’s awe-striking architecture and sense of Christmas spirit.</p> <p>Although we were all quite tired from the day’s travels, we went to the famous Christmas market in front of the glowing parliament building in Vienna. We spent the evening there basking in the glow of the Christmas lights and then had our dinner at the famous <br /> Café Landtmann.</p> <p><img src="/blog/images/2024-12-29-alluring-austria-1.jpeg" alt="Image Description" /></p> <h1 id="23-december---viennas-wonder">23 December - Vienna’s Wonder</h1> <p>I woke up with a headache, perhaps from last night’s bad dinner? I remember it being pretty cold and windy, not unlike Amsterdam. The wind reduces the temperature by five degrees, it feels.</p> <p>The trams go through narrow inner streets, quite hard to imagine it’s the same city with seven lane main roads. I guess parts of the city have their own character. At Vienna, old and new coexist in harmony. We saw buildings of centuries past, and telephone booths of decades past – existing with fast cars and modern camera phones in the hands of its citizens. The feeling of overwhelm at the thought that I’m in the city which played the stage to both world wars. In fact much the history goes much before that, I saw ruins from the roman era.</p> <p>In the evening, I gifted Mohana a Swarovski ring, I think she liked it. I had been wanting to gift her one for six months, ever since I first went to a Swarovski store in Amsterdam to buy a wedding gift for Ritvika. Prior to that, I never had the courage or the intent to buy jewellery from such a high-end brand! Finally I could afford to get one for my wife. Happy days. Of all the things I look forward to at work, all the promotions, all the bonuses, none of it will have been worth it if I couldn’t get something nice for her. Come layoffs or not, this was a fulfilling day.</p> <p><img src="/blog/images/2024-12-29-alluring-austria-2.jpeg" alt="Image Description" /> <img src="/blog/images/2024-12-29-alluring-austria-3.jpeg" alt="Image Description" /></p> <h1 id="24th-december---infatuated-by-innsbruck">24th December - Infatuated by Innsbruck</h1> <p>We left Vienna for Innsbruck today, which I knew to be a much colder and smaller city. I am not very fond of small towns, especially coming from the grand architectural style of Vienna. But everyone was quite excited about the subzero temperature, especially Brinda, for her sake I hoped we get to see some snow.</p> <p>Innsbruck is a small Austrian town nestled in the Alps – everything was covered in a feet of snow, it was quite the view. We learned later that in Austria, Christmas is celebrated on the eve much more than Christmas day. Because of that, we couldn’t find any open restaurant or grocery store. We had lunch at the only open eatery, a not great but not bad pizza.</p> <p><img src="/blog/images/2024-12-29-alluring-austria-4.jpeg" alt="Image Description" /></p> <h1 id="25-december---my-first-white-christmas">25 December - My first white Christmas</h1> <p>It was Christmas morning in the snow-clad village of Innsbruck. Mohana and I left the warm hotel room to take a walk in -8 degrees. We saw the sunrise reflect on the grand white mountain peaks, we slipped on the snow, we held hands in allure of this mortal world’s incomprehensible beauty. Neither pictures nor words can capture the scenic marvel.</p> <p>After a sumptuous breakfast at the hotel, we went to the old town centre at Innsbruck in the sun as the snow glistened and the mountains in the backdrop looked upon us. We spent some time in the city and then came back up to the mountain and went to a ski resort — and played with snowballs, it truly was a day in the snow, my first ever – all on Christmas day at that!</p> <p>As I beheld the majestic mountains, my thoughts turned to my childhood. One of the many great things my father taught me is to seek out inner peace and inner happiness, free of seeking external admiration – the mountains surely do not stand there for our admiration. After all these years, I think all of it made sense right then and there - we are just insignificant footnotes in the face of nature’s vast allure. Nothing I ever do will be a fraction of the spellbinding Alps - enormous in size, having passed the test of time. I felt a touch of inner peace at the foot of these snow-draped massive ranges.</p> <p>We went to a ski resort in the hills – all the way up to the top of the hill on which our hotel was. We played with snowballs and gathered around for a hot cup of coffee. When we came back, we played the game of Dixit and had dinner at the hotel.</p> <p><img src="/blog/images/2024-12-29-alluring-austria-5.jpeg" alt="Image Description" /></p> <h1 id="26th-december---leaving-the-mountains-behind">26th December - Leaving the mountains behind</h1> <p>There’s a calmness that comes with the cold. The silence too. I remember standing out in front of the frozen snow as the calmness of the cold echoed back. Left with my thoughts, staring at the snow clad mountains at the distance, while the church bell begins to toll at a distance as if to acknowledge an onlooker’s gaze – a white Christmas, with not a speck of green grass visible.</p> <p>We left the snow capped hills behind as we head towards Salzburg via train. I didn’t yet know what was in store after Innsbruck but I’d be lying if I said I’m happy to leave. This was heaven on earth, in every sense of the word. Every sight was a postcard. Majestic mountains at the distance, at its foot are the little houses in the valley – paying homage to the might of the giant hills. The mountains in turn protecting the valley from the rest of the world. A harmony borne of balance and mutual respect. Behind them all clear blue sky, crisp white snow and a golden sun reflecting the morning rays, while chime of wrens flying against the backdrop of a landscape coated in icing sugar. Just another day in paradise.</p> <p>The train shot away at 250 kilometres an hour, ploughing through a snow covered land, from the window it looks like airplanes going through white clouds. I really liked the coniferous trees with snow resting on its branches giving it a shaded look from afar. Forests look like wolves with coloured fur.</p> <p>When we finally reached the city of sound of music, Salzburg, we went to Fortress Hohensalzburg, the view was breathtaking but soon it became very cold. Battling the cold, we sat down to enjoy a hot wiener sausage and called it a day. Back in the hotel, we gathered around like old friends, and chatted about life in Singapore and of the days of boyhood wonder and pranks in the streets of Calcutta. Sometimes that’s all you need, the quiet embrace of family and familiarity.</p> <p><img src="/blog/images/2024-12-29-alluring-austria-6.jpeg" alt="Image Description" /></p> <h1 id="27th-december---a-snow-kissed-village">27th December - A Snow-kissed Village</h1> <p>We went to an UNESCO village called Halstad today from Salzburg. On the way to Halstad, the sun rose as we climbed the mountains, golden sun rays gently caressing the untouched snow. Standing before us, was a wonderful view of a frozen village – beautiful village nestled in the Alps covered in snow next to a lake. Honestly, I thought this trip would be good. But even in my most hopeful optimism, I didn’t think it would be this good. I’d consider this to perhaps be the best trip I have ever taken, including Switzerland, Egypt and incredible India. In fact, heaven must look a lot like this.</p> <p>It is hard to believe such an alluring land gave birth to one of humanity’s most tyrannical leaders. But no one spec of dirt can diminish the enduring splendour of this land. I guess, kindness always prevails, humanity prevails, beauty prevails notwithstanding the worst son of Austria.</p> <p>We came back to Salzburg in the afternoon with a twinkle in our eyes. The ride back to Salzburg was a peek into nature’s unspoilt beauty. We walked around Salzburg, went to Mirabel garden, visited Mozart house (where he was born) and then to a pebble beach and threw skipping stones into the river. Simple pleasures of life. </p> <p><img src="/blog/images/2024-12-29-alluring-austria-7.jpeg" alt="Image Description" /></p> <h1 id="28th-december---a-misdirection">28th December - A Misdirection</h1> <p>We left from the hotel at Salzburg today on the way to Vienna, one last huzzah before we head back to Amsterdam. As fate would have it, couple of us got on the wrong train! We went ahead of the group with the intention of capturing seats. The problem was that there was another train at the same platform to same direction at the same time, but it wasn’t our train. We got on the train thinking that if the direction is towards Vienna, at the platform when we expect our train, it must be our train. We pulled the SOS button in the hope of stopping the train and we got seriously reprimanded by the ticket checker! We got off at the next station Linz and joined them when our intended train arrived.</p> <p>While we were on the wrong train, we had a worry that we we might be charged a fine for sounding the alarm. We spoke about how life sometimes gives us situations beyond our control. Somehow, my thoughts went to Negi, a friend of my brother’s who tragically lost his life to a silent brain tumour, life can be harsh if it so wants. One of us brought up the story of a cancer survivor, who had to risk it all but fortune was on his side, রাখে হরি মারে কে, মারে হরি রাখে কে?</p> <p>As the correct train approached the station, we almost missed the train again because it was only a minute’s stop. Although we managed to get on the right train at Linz. But we are separated from the rest of the group because the train has two parts with an engine in the middle. So it was not possible to go where the rest of them are sitting! So at the station after Linz, we again went out of the train, and finally made it to the right compartment in the right train! We did finally return to Vienna - the city’s architecture never ceased to catch my awe.</p> <p>After reaching Vienna, we went to Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien (Art History Museum). It was really large. We saw items from ancient egypt, Ancient Greece, Roman era, and paintings. We realised soon that due to the train debacle, we totally forgot about lunch and all of us were hungry - we had to almost run into a restaurant from the museum – we had dinner at six in the evening, a quite hearty meal, like all hungry stomachs deserve. Soon after, I slept off early to catch the morning flight back to Amsterdam.</p> <p><img src="/blog/images/2024-12-29-alluring-austria-8.jpeg" alt="Image Description" /></p> </article> </main> <div class="footer"> <a href="/blog/">Blog</a> &#124; <a target="_blank" href="https://mourjo.me/cv.pdf">CV</a> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
