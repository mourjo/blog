<p>I was watching Ted Lasso the other day - and I recall this quote. Football is to the players, what software engineering is to me. I always found joy in it - yet on slow days like this, it is hard to get the needle moving.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I brought you here to remind you that football is a fucking game that you used to play as a fucking kid because it was fun. Even when you were getting your fucking legs broken or your fucking feelings hurt. So fuck your feelings, fuck your overthinking, fuck all that bullshit. Go back out there and have some fucking fun.</p>

  <p>– Roy Kent (Ted Lasso)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For me, having fun means going back to coding – leaving all the piling work aside – just building something where there was nothing. Today it is about <a href="https://github.com/mourjo/monster-scale-2025">writing a load-shedding server using Spring Boot</a>.</p>

The last few weeks were quite stressful at work, and I was very earnestly looking forward to a break. Any vacation would have been the break I needed but Austria was nothing short of alluring.</p>

<h1 id="22nd-december---arriving-in-austria">22nd December - Arriving in Austria</h1>

<p>The flight from Amsterdam to  the captivating city of Vienna was an hour-and-a-half long. The temperature was colder than in Amsterdam but there is no wind. Still, with the same amount of rain and absence of the sun, it felt much more comfortable here.</p>

<p>We dropped our bags at the hotel and went for a walk around the city centre (a UNESCO world heritage site), discovering the awe-striking architecture and jubilating Christmas spirit. I was transfixed at the thought that Vienna played a critical role in both world wars, houses United Nations headquarters, and is the city of both Mozart and Beethoven. It is certainly an old city hiding many stories, countless struggles and much wisdom.</p>

<p>Although we were naturally tired from the day’s travels, we made it a point to go to Vienna’s famous Christmas market in front of the glowing parliament building. To conclude the day, we partook in the city’s coffeehouse culture and dined at the famous Café Landtmann.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/2024-12-29-alluring-austria-1.jpeg" alt="Image Description" /></p>

<h1 id="23rd-december---viennas-wonder">23rd December - Vienna’s Wonder</h1>
<p>I woke up with a mild headache, perhaps from last night’s cold – I remember it being chilly and windy, not unlike Amsterdam. The wind reduces the temperature by five degrees, it feels.</p>

<p>The trams in Vienna go through narrow inner streets, quite hard to imagine it’s the same city with five-lane main roads. Different parts of the city have their own distinguishing character, and they coexist in harmony. The city has a blend of historical charm and modern vibrancy – buildings and telephone booths of decades past in coexistence with fast cars and modern camera phones in the hands of its citizens.</p>

<p>Our first stop today was Schönbrunn Palace. We bought a couple of jars of very spicy pickle made from Habanero (a type of Capsicum) from the Christmas market in the palace grounds. In the Christmas market, there were bales of hay for children to climb on, reminding me of the episode from The Office where Dwight builds a hay palace in the parking lot. We then went to Belvedere Palace, which although not as famous, had a much more scenic (and possibly larger) garden. Right across from Belvedere Palace was a Greek restaurant, which served us a really hearty chicken soup. But frankly, the warmth of the cafe made us much happier than the food!</p>

<p>In the evening, to commemorate the trip I gifted Mohana a ring made by the Austrian jewellery brand Swarovski. I had been wanting to gift her one for six months, ever since I first went to a Swarovski store in Amsterdam to buy a wedding gift for Ritvika. Prior to that, I never had the courage or the intent to buy jewellery from such an expensive luxury brand! Today though, I could afford to get one for my wife. Happy days. Of all the things I look forward to in life, all the promotions, all the bonuses, none of it will have been worth it if I could not get something nice for her. Come layoffs or not, today was a fulfilling day.</p>

<h1 id="24th-december---infatuated-by-innsbruck">24th December - Infatuated by Innsbruck</h1>

<p>We left Vienna for Innsbruck today, which I knew to be a much colder and smaller city. On the one hand, I am not very fond of small towns, even less so coming from the grand architectural backdrop of Vienna. On the other hand, I was quite excited about the prospect of visiting a snowy Alpine town that was twice a home to the Winter Olympics.</p>

<p>As the train approached the town, the density of snow on the ground kept rising - by the time we reached, everything was covered in a feet of snow, it was quite the view! My enthusiasm was at par with that of the youngest member of our group - five year old Brinda. Nature’s ability to captivate us transcends barriers of age.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we found ourselves quite puzzled that there were no open restaurants or grocery stores. After a while of wandering the empty streets, we shared Italian pizzas for lunch at the only open eatery we could find, and even they insisted on closing shop soon. We learned later that in Austria, Christmas is celebrated widely on the eve much more than on the day.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/2024-12-29-alluring-austria-3.jpeg" alt="Image Description" /></p>

<h1 id="25th-december---my-first-white-christmas">25th December - My first white Christmas</h1>

<p>It was Christmas morning in the snow-clad village of Innsbruck. Mohana and I left the warm hotel room to take a walk in -8 degrees. We saw the sunrise reflect on the grand white mountain peaks, we slipped on the snow, we held hands in allure of this mortal world’s incomprehensible beauty. Neither pictures nor words could capture the scenic marvel.</p>

<p>After a sumptuous breakfast at the hotel, we went to the old town centre at Innsbruck in the sun as the snow glistened and the mountains in the backdrop looked upon us. We spent some time in the city and then went to a ski resort — as we played with snowballs and made snow-angels, I recognized that this was my first white Christmas – with not a speck of green grass visible.</p>

<p>As I beheld the majestic mountains, my thoughts turned to my childhood. One of the many great things my father taught me is to seek out inner peace and inner happiness, thereby unburdening myself of seeking external admiration – just as the mountains surely do not stand there for our admiration. After all these years, I think all of it made sense right then and there - we are just insignificant footnotes in the face of nature’s vast allure. I felt a touch of inner peace at the sight of these massive snow-draped ranges.</p>

<p>When we came back, we played the game of Dixit and had dinner at the hotel.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/2024-12-29-alluring-austria-4.jpeg" alt="Image Description" /></p>

<h1 id="26th-december---leaving-the-mountains-behind">26th December - Leaving the mountains behind</h1>

<p>The sun rose quietly in Innsbruck, afraid of waking the sleeping mountains. There was a constant calmness that came with the cold morning air. At a distance, a church bell’s toll sheared the stillness of the cold atmosphere – as if to acknowledge an onlooker’s gaze.</p>

<p>We left the snow capped hills behind as we headed towards Salzburg. I did not yet know what was in store after Innsbruck but I would be lying if I said I was happy to leave. Innsbruck was heaven on earth, in every sense of the word. Every sight was a postcard, every photograph a masterpiece. Majestic mountains at the distance, at its foot the little houses in the valley – paying homage to the might of the giant hills. The mountains in turn protecting the valley from the rest of the world. A harmony borne of balance and mutual respect. Behind them all was a clear blue sky and a golden sun’s morning rays reflecting on a landscape coated in icing sugar. A chime of wrens flew by, celebrating just another day in paradise.</p>

<p>The train shot away at 250 kilometres an hour, ploughing through a snow covered land, from the window it looked like airplanes going through white clouds. I really liked the coniferous trees with snow resting on its branches giving it a shaded look from afar. Forests look like wolves with coloured fur.</p>

<p>When we finally reached the city of sound of music, Salzburg, we went to Fortress Hohensalzburg, the view was breathtaking but soon it became very cold. Battling the cold, we sat down to enjoy a hot wiener sausage and called it a day. Back in the hotel, we gathered around like old friends, and chatted about life in Amsterdam and Singapore and of the days of boyhood wonder and childish pranks in the streets of Calcutta. Sometimes that is all you need, the quiet embrace of family and familiarity.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/2024-12-29-alluring-austria-5.jpeg" alt="Image Description" /></p>

<h1 id="27th-december---a-snow-kissed-village">27th December - A Snow-kissed Village</h1>

<p>We went to an UNESCO village called Halstad from Salzburg. On the way to Halstad, the sun rose as we climbed the mountains, golden sun rays gently caressing the untouched snow. Standing before us, was a wonderful view of a frozen village – beautifully nestled in the Alps covered in snow next to a lake. Honestly, I thought this trip would be good. But even in my most hopeful optimism, I didn’t think it would be this good. I consider this to be the best trip I have ever taken thus far, including Switzerland, Egypt and incredible India.</p>

<p>It is hard to believe such an alluring land gave birth to one of humanity’s most tyrannical leaders. No one spec of dirt can diminish the enduring splendour of this land. I guess kindness always prevails, humanity always prevails, beauty always prevails notwithstanding the worst son of Austria.</p>

<p>We came back to Salzburg in the afternoon with a twinkle in our eyes. The ride back to Salzburg was a peek into nature’s unspoilt beauty – the bus ride went through hilly coniferous forests and vast trenches of land completely covered in snow. We walked around Salzburg, went to Mirabel garden, visited Mozart house (where he was born) and then to a pebble beach and threw skipping stones into the river. Simple pleasures of life. </p>

<h1 id="28th-december---a-misdirection">28th December - A Misdirection</h1>

<p>We left from the hotel at Salzburg on the way to Vienna, one last huzzah before we head back to Amsterdam. As fate would have it, a couple of us got on the wrong train! We went ahead of the group with the intention of reserving window seats. Little did we know that there was another train at the same platform to same destination at the same time. Once the train pulled away earlier than our expectations, we discerned our blunder. We pulled the SOS button in the hope of stopping the train and we got seriously reprimanded by the ticket checker! We got off at the next station at Linz and joined the rest of our group when our intended train arrived – thankfully both trains did stop at the same station.</p>

<p>While we were on the wrong train, we worried that we might be charged a fine for sounding the alarm. We spoke about how life often gives us situations beyond our control. Somehow, my thoughts went to Negi, a friend of my brother, who tragically lost his life to a silent brain tumour, life can be harsh if it so wants and there is nothing one can do about it. One of us brought up the story of a cancer survivor, who fought for fifteen years but in the end, fortune was on his side. রাখে হরি মারে কে, মারে হরি রাখে কে?</p>

<p>As the correct train approached Linz, we almost missed the train again because it was only a minute’s stop. Although we managed to get on the right train at Linz. Unfortunately, we were separated from the rest of the group because the train had two parts with an engine in the middle. Therefore, it was not possible to go where the rest of them are sitting! So at the station after Linz, we again went out of the train, and finally made it to the right compartment in the right train! We did finally return to Vienna - the city’s architecture never ceased to catch my awe – even after our little trainwreck.</p>

<p>After reaching Vienna, we went to Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien (Art History Museum). We saw items from ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, Roman era, and paintings. Of all the artefacts, the one that caught my eye was called “Triumph of St. Michael over Satan” by 
Johann Schnegg. It was a statue made of ivory, depicting St. Michael in white and Satan in black – an yin-yang of a different kind.</p>

<p>We realised soon that owing to the train debacle earlier in the morning, we blissfully forgot about lunch and all of us were hungry - we had to rush to a restaurant from the museum – we had dinner at six in the evening, a quite hearty meal, like all hungry stomachs deserve.</p>

<p>Soon after, I slept off early to catch the morning flight back to Amsterdam.</p>

I am almost never the tallest person in the room either.</p>

<p>It is a lost game, in my opinion, the pursuit of being the best at anything in a world of 8 billion people. Trying to be the best or rather, trying to <em>be portrayed to be the best</em>, incentivises the wrong behaviour. Admitting that I am not the smartest person in the room unburdens me from proving to an external observer and to myself, that I am the smartest.</p>

Whether statically typed or not, the success of a language today <em>depends heavily on the developer tooling and developer experience</em>.</p>

<p>Code is only just a means to an end — the end being value addition for the customer. Languages with extensive tooling make it easier for developers, thereby increasing their value proposition to the business. I find that the effectiveness of the median developer is dependent on a language’s tooling support - finding usages of a method, renaming a method, stepping through a codepath just to see where something gets updated, and so on…</p>

<p>This is the kind of <a href="https://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2010/03/18/essential-and-accidental-complexity/">accidental complexity</a> that today’s tech ecosystem is ossified by – <strong>missing language capabilities being solved with tooling has led to an over-reliance of developers on the tooling rather than the language itself</strong>. Think about it — would you write Java without Lombok or boilerplate code generation?</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>It’s hard to imagine a surer sign that one is dealing with an irrational economic system than the fact that the prospect of eliminating drudgery is considered to be a problem.</p>

  <p>– David Graeber, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38217638-bullshit-jobs">Bullshit Jobs: A Theory</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>With LLMs to assist developers writing code, I think <em>the value proposition of developer tooling will take a new shape</em>. There will always be a need for some sort of tooling, but it may turn out to be <em>general-purpose tools</em>, rather than <em>language-specific ones</em> that win.</p>

<p>In a world where the barrier to entry into coding is lower, the test of a language’s success will depend solely (and rightly) on its ability to deliver business value. If a language is fundamentally more effective in doing so – irrespective of its tooling – it may come out on top in the age of AI.</p>

<p>After years of working with Java (and relying heavily on the tooling ecosystem), I will now be betting on Clojure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is just simpler, and easier, and less occluding to write expressive code in Clojure. It requires fewer lines. It requires fewer characters. It requires fewer hours. It requires fewer mental gymnastics. Lisp (Clojure) is functional. And the future is looking very functional to me.</p>

Over the years, I remember comparing my palm side-by-side to his - it is an almost identical copy of Dadua’s. In fact, I would say it with pride – a cherished emblem that I carried with a sense of honour. When I heard the heartbreaking news at three in the morning, my immediate response was to look at my own palm in the dim light of the smartphone, not knowing what this meant or how to feel about it.</p>

<p><em>I kept staring at my palm in the engulfing darkness of the cold Dutch night.</em></p>

<p>As a child of parents with transferable jobs, my boyhood unfolded across various locations: Alipore, Birbhum, Bardhaman and Salt Lake. One place that was constant throughout was Lake Temple Road and Dadua. My earliest memories as a child were with Dadua. His cane with an elephant’s trunk curve at the end, his fast strides which were so hard for my short legs to keep up with, the crisp morning air of Rabindra Sarobar lake before day break, and of course the “notun jinish dekhbo” which was an euphemism for toys without my mother realising I am asking for something new.</p>

<p>While I was too young to fully remember the morning walks I took with Dadua, fragments of those memories linger in my mind. I recall moments such as meeting his friends by the lake, to the local chaiwalla who knew precisely what everyone wanted, to the almost superhero names I had for each of his friends (like Amloki-dadu and Bhim-dadu). Sometimes in the evenings he would take me for a walk around the lake as well, but this time, it was not to meet his friends, but to have a Vadilal ice cream and sometimes freshly roasted peanuts. To this day, the smell of warm peanuts takes me back to that time. I was old enough when I got the news of him passing away in his sleep, yet deep down, I was still the little boy who yearns for one more morning walk with his grandfather.</p>

<p><em>I kept staring at my palm in the engulfing darkness of the cold Dutch night.</em></p>

<p>In Bardhaman, we resided in an expansive estate adorned with boundless fields of crops and parks full of flowers and orchards teeming with trees. I remember Dadua took me on a tour of the estate sharing his knowledge about crops and the art of nurturing plant life. As a lifelong gardener himself, he imparted a wealth of wisdom to my uncomprehending preadolescent ears.</p>

<p>Although I may not recall the intricacies of gardening techniques, certain moments are indelibly engraved as if they were from last week. One such recollection is him showing me how to collect dried seeds from different fruits and use them as beads to play with and make little craft items of it. Of all the toys I received as gifts that birthday in Bardhaman, today I seem to only recall this: a concoction of odd plant seeds that remain etched in memory because of the loving embrace of a grandfather and the spark of creativity that was so very characteristic of Dadua.</p>

<p>He not only was creative himself, but ignited creativity in others too. I daresay, my mother’s fondness for recitation was kindled by Dadua. During one summer, I made a toy “smart” watch from a piece of black cardboard and a few hand-drawn digital dials. Mimi took me to a tailor to procure an elastic strap for the watch band, and with Dadua’s assistance, we assembled it all together. While I merely did it to emulate all the watch-wearing grown ups around me, Dadua confided in me that as a boy he also used scrap material as a child to craft things. This early inclination eventually led him to create his vast collection of handmade artefacts. I recall he said to me a few years later that art is different to each of us –  everyone looking at the same tree but since every other person is seeing it from a different vantage point, it is not really the same tree they are looking at – everyone’s impression of the same tree is different.</p>

<p><em>I kept staring at my palm in the engulfing darkness of the cold Dutch night.</em></p>

<p>Atop the four-storey building on Lake Temple Road, was a sanctuary of lush platlife – all meticulously tended to by Dadua. For the longest time, Lake Temple felt akin to the story of Charlie’s chocolate factory, only healthier – abounding with banana, papaya, cauliflower, coriander, mango, pumpkin, chillies, shojne, and the lemons. On numerous occasions, Dadua would take my brother and me to the roof to pick out lemons straight from the tree. As we plucked the fruit from the plant, the natural aroma of the gondhoraj lemons permeated the air while we helped him bag the lemons for us to take home.</p>

<p>At one point of time, there was even a water reservoir to cultivate fish on the same rooftop.
Picture this: smack in the heart of the urban grey slate of Calcutta, a green nugget of nature nestled in the unlikely location of a rooftop, tended to by one man - where plant and waterlife thrived alike. I would call that Eden on Earth, wouldn’t you?</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">
আমার মুক্তি আলোয় আলোয় এই আকাশে <br />
আমার মুক্তি ধুলায় ধুলায় ঘাসে ঘাসে
</p>

<p>Dadua was a man at one with nature, and nature reciprocated that connection. He used to often tell us that plants have feelings and plants understand when they are cared for. During his younger days, he ventured far and wide in search of plants that were uncommon and unthinkable to grow on small pots. The mango plant for instance, that grew on a pot and bore fruit all throughout the year, was an accomplishment that filled him particularly with pride.</p>

<p><em>I kept staring at my palm in the engulfing darkness of the cold Dutch night.</em></p>

<p>As I grew from a toddler to “a young man”, as he would phrase it, Dadua shared stories, folktales, Sanskrit slokas and poems with me and my brother. He tried his best to instil in us the wisdom from passages from many pieces of literature. Long before I could grasp the concept of religion, I had already committed to memory some of the verses from Ma Durga’s prayers. Even these days during Ashtami anjali, the verse “Sarbamangala Mangalyay” triggers the memory of Dadua sitting on is armchair, with his red book of Hindu Slokas in his hand reading passages out to us in the backdrop of the soft rustling of leaves from the trees he planted in the driveway of Lake Temple road.</p>

<p>Dadua was known to be a master-reciter, with the innate ability to recall thousand-line poems like he was reading an invisible paper in front of him. Once on Rabindrajayanti at the Lake, he brought me to one of his performances. Although I did not understand the poem, I did understand that everyone’s attention was pinned on his recitation. He taught me many poems from the “Sishu” collection of Tagore’s poems made specifically for children.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">
মনে করো যেন বিদেশ ঘুরে <br />
মাকে নিয়ে যাচ্ছি অনেক দূরে <br />
তুমি যাচ্ছ পালকিতে মা চড়ে <br />
আমি যাচ্ছি রাঙা ঘোড়ার ‘পরে <br />
</p>

<p><em>I kept staring at my palm in the engulfing darkness of the cold Dutch night.</em></p>

<p>Dadua was a captivating storyteller. As I grew older, the stories he told me also took a more mature form. What were stories from the Ramayan and Mahabharat, became anecdotes from his own life and choices that defined who he was. He recounted the river next to his childhood home in Comilla where fishermen sold fish right after catching it, his boyhood days spent in his school Ishwar Pathshala, his meeting Rabindranath Tagore, about his aspirations for going to art school, fond recollections of his mother, whom he lost at an early age, of the stern yet spirited chancellor of BE college of yesteryear and of Vergese Kurian, founder of Amul, who was his classmate at National Dairy Research Institute in Bangalore.</p>

<p>His home in SN Banerjee Road was close to Anadi Cabin. On the day of his graduation from BE College, he recalled how much he enjoyed a plate of Mughlai Parathas – he fondly recalled that the owner of the restaurant (I think Anadi himself) decided not to charge him when he found out it was his graduation day.</p>

<p>I felt a profound connection to his stories, bupt none more than those centred around Kurseong and Keventer’s. Even till this day, a trip to Darjeeling is incomplete without visiting Keventer’s restaurant. His stories always took me to faraway hill stations that he visited – sometimes to supervise tea estates – sometimes to overlook another part of his business. On one occasion, he told us how he found his way to a cabin when his car had broken down in a hilly deserted forest, and in his hour of despair, he met a classmate from BE college.</p>

<p><em>I kept staring at my palm in the engulfing darkness of the cold Dutch night.</em></p>

<p>Mimi’s passing marked the end of what I recall as childhood. The house became quieter and both Dadua and Dia suddenly seemed to age overnight. Thus began a different era in Lake temple. Over the ensuing years, Dadua got ill a few times. After coming back from the hospital one time, he was quite frail and could barely make it to the dining table. Words that will forever keep ringing in my ears were “Dadua kheyecho” (he used to call me “Dadua” as well) – even in the weakest moments, he was still enquiring about my well-being. Lake temple right there, as it was, and as it is today, will always be defined by moments like these – transforming what I used to call “Daduar bari” to much more than a house and into something greater than myself, a cornerstone and source of eternal strength.</p>

<p><em>I kept staring at my palm in the engulfing darkness of the cold Dutch night.</em></p>

<p>The day after I got the news, I was looking for some photos of Dadua – I found many of Dia’s, only a few of Dadua’s. In one of them during bhai-phota, Dadua was there just in the background. I was about to scroll past it when it struck me that that was him in his true essence – ever present and away from the limelight. Even then, there was one photo on a warm summer’s noon, when he was front and centre, smiling as bright as the sun overhead. Being the eldest, I was the first in my generation to get a job. Mimi had long left for the heavenly abode and in the ensuing five years, the deepest sense of pride I ever allowed myself was when using my own money, I bought Dadua a Panjabi and Dia a saree. Oh you should have been there to see his smile. He didn’t have the habit of dressing up or going outside to restaurants but in his words “it’s to celebrate my Dadua’s first job, of course I will dress up”. One of the photos from that day captured his effervescent smile so well that it is being framed to be the photograph to remember him by. To mean as much to someone is not something I know how to put into words.</p>

<p><em>I kept staring at my palm in the engulfing darkness of the cold Dutch night.</em></p>

<p>Mohana met Dadua only after we got married. But she knew of him from our college days – till date, she recalls how awestruck she was hearing of Dadua’s technological prowess. Back in the early 2010s, we were all on the broadband bandwagon and it was liberating to have an omnipresent connection called “wifi”. It might have been considered a young man’s experiment in most households, but not in Lake Temple Road. Not only did Dadua have his own laptop, smartphone and wifi setup, he became quite famous among my friends for insisting to upgrade his poor BSNL network to a faster Airtel one! He honed new ideas for handicraft from the internet and I often got to see him trying new tools like a hot glue gun and coloured glue sticks, which he used to make desk items like pen holders.</p>

<p><em>I kept staring at my palm in the engulfing darkness of the cold Dutch night.</em></p>

<p>If you pass by Shib Mandir, you may be forgiven for not noticing the otherwise unremarkable building that stands at Lake Temple Road. To me though, it is a foundational pillar to who I was as a child and who I became as an adult, and Dadua is an integral part of that and I will forever miss him. I met Dadua for the last time on March 24, 2023. I am still grappling with the harsh reality that I will never see him again. What stays with me are his stories, his lifestyle, his teachings, and his appreciation for the arts. I recall him reciting the following passage often with glistening eyes. Today it holds a very special place as I cling to his memory.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">
ফিরায়ে দিনু দ্বারের চাবি,  রাখি না আর ঘরের দাবি— <br />

things that pay off in the long run as much as the ability to form habits easily. In
retrospect, starting to do something like working out every other day, reading at a
particular time of day, preparing for teaching a lesson – all have benefited from
repetitive incremental progress through habits. Here are three things that have helped me
build habits.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Anchoring</strong>: While building habits, it is easier to associate the new activity to an
existing habit that you’re used to. For example, if going out for a run is already part
of your day, then adding a post-run task like having your pills is easier than
remembering to have it at 7 am. Once a habit becomes part of the day, it can then become
an anchor for another new habit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Planning</strong>: Part of building a habit is repetition, and for something to be
repeatable, it should not change much. That is, chalk out a plan beforehand, maybe the
previous day (tweak it if required) but stick to it through thick and thin – take
the thinking or optionality out of the activity. If I am planning to run 5 km in the
morning, the option of cutting the run short should not even be present. A more detailed
plan, for example, a 1 km pre-run warm up and a post run cool down, takes the thinking
out of the picture and knowing it is obligatory even in those days that are
tiring, makes build the habit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reviewing</strong>: One of the best things a smart watch has helped me with, in so far as
workouts are considered, is a review of the last day/week’s activities. If I had been
able to do all of my workouts in the week, looking back and reviewing it is a great
sense of accomplishment, while not being able to do so is a reason to push harder in the
next day/week. In terms of general habit-building, such reviewing of past activities has
helped me make a conscious effort for those missed triggers, because as humans those are
bound to happen.</p>
  </li>

The journey thus far has been incredible, and it is inspiring to think that in the span of three months, all of the following have happened.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Functional programming</li>
  <li>Advanced data structures (including Bloom filters!)</li>
  <li>Two major projects: A <a href="https://otee.dev/2021/08/24/crisp-a-simple-lisp-interpreter.html">Lisp interpreter</a> and a <a href="https://twitter.com/cardimomT">blog post tweet bot</a> that I hope will publish this post</li>
  <li>Computer architecture, all the way from the hardware to the instruction execution cycle</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the perks of being able to have the opportunity to teach the fundamentals is that I get to relearn these concepts from a very different perspective, all over again. I have had to research on my own before I feel confident enough to teach and what that has opened up for me, is to see those concepts deep down through the experience of being in the industry for five years.</p>

<p>Teaching something convincingly requires research and it is liberating to be able to learn all those things again, and I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys this subject. Imagine thinking from first principles and even questioning those first principles. When I was first exposed to the fundamentals, I didn’t know any better than to take things at their face value and that obviously left holes in my knowledge, not to mention all the things I didn’t even remember I had once learned. During the depths of the pandemic, learning by teaching has been one of the most rewarding exercises.</p>

I
decided to help him with this endeavour. Being from a non-technical background, his
knowledge of Computer Science is limited to high school HelloWorlds. It is both a huge
responsibility and honour for me to be part of his journey. My paramount goal is to ensure
the gets a <em>good enough</em> guidance to venture into this field. The weight of being able to
show the right path is heavy, but it is worth trying.</p>

<p>Here’s what I have in mind (it is probably going to change). I have created the following
broad headings of what I think are the most useful areas to spend time on.</p>

<ol>
  <li>CS fundamentals
    <ul>
      <li>Computer Architecture</li>
      <li>Networking</li>
      <li>Operating Systems</li>
      <li>Databases</li>
      <li>Basics of a compiler</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Programming
    <ul>
      <li>Javascript basics from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#claim-cert-block">FreeCodeCamp</a></li>
      <li>Data structures</li>
      <li>Algorithms</li>
      <li>Problem solving (something like <a href="http://leetcode.com">Leetcode</a>)</li>
      <li>Functional languages / OOP</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tooling workflows
    <ul>
      <li>Linux CLI</li>
      <li>Git</li>
      <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Web Development (after 1)
    <ul>
      <li>Server / Client</li>
      <li>Web scale, components, technologies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I pondered a lot on which language and IDE to suggest for him to learn. Eventually I concluded
that Javascript and VS Code seem to be the most ubiquitous combination there is for web
development. <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/courses/full-stack-web-development">Lambda School</a>
also seems to be favouring Javascript.</p>

<p>The list above is biased on what I think I am good enough to guide with. Much to the same
reason, there is no mention of machine learning or frontend technologies like CSS,
although a bit of that might be necessary.</p>

<p>At the end of six months from now, based on the progress, my objective is for him to be
ready for applying to coding bootcamps like <a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Centre</a>. If
not that, then with some more work, a candidate for applying to junior engineering
positions, like I did back in 2015 – only better than what I was back then.</p>

<p>In an effort to prove to myself that I could take on this long and ardous (and eventually
rewarding) journey, I hope to publish regular posts here about the progress I am making as
a guide, so stay tuned and if you’re reading this, wish me luck!</p>]]></content><author><name>{&quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;&quot;mourjo_sen&quot;}</name></author><category term="mentoring" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oitee is convinced that he can learn Computer Science basics as a part-time activity.
