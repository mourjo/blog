I am never the smartest person in the room -- and that's okay. I am almost never the tallest person in the room either. 

It is a lost game, in my opinion, the pursuit of being the best at anything in a world of 8 billion people. Trying to be the best or rather, trying to *be portrayed to be the best*, incentivises the wrong behaviour. Admitting that I am not the smartest person in the room unburdens me from proving to an external observer and to myself, that I am the smartest.  

I can instead utilise every opportunity to learn from anyone who has an interesting idea -- be it the college graduate who only joined the team last week or the veteran who has been often called an outdated dinosaur. Here is a list of things I would never have learnt about if smartness ego battles got in the way (battles I would have miserably lost):
- Communicating sequential processes and [core/async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) in Clojure
- The practice of note-taking in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and the [second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/)
- [Hexagonal architecture](https://medium.com/booking-com-development/hexagonal-architecture-a-practical-guide-5bc6d5a6a056)
- A [laser printer's](https://medium.com/curious-burrows/the-story-of-open-source-so-far-bfcb685d85a4) relation to open source
- Better command line tools [written in Rust](https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/)
- [Courage](https://otee.dev/2021/12/31/looking-back-2021.html) to do the right thing when it is not easy

I am *never going to be the smartest person in the room*, but I can be the person who wants to learn the most in the room -- and then come out of that room a *relatively smarter version of myself*.
