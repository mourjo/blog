A day in a software engineer's week becomes blurry from one another. It is not uncommon to get caught up in the rut of things. Today happens to be one of those slow Sunday mornings at the end of a busy week. I have a lot of reading to catch up on, but I just cannot concentrate on any of it.

Sure, I do many things at my job that I have grown to love (the yellows) -- writing about software, designing systems, technical leadership, planning... But all of the things I have grown to love have their roots somehow to the crux of what I truly enjoy doing (the greens): writing code -- for no reason, for no outcome, for no one -- just me building something where there was nothing.

In the show, Ted Lasso, football is to the players, what software engineering is to me -- I do it because I enjoy it. In all honesty though, I would be lying if I said I love every bit of it. On good weeks, the yellows often become greens, and the reds start looking like yellows. Yet, as I grow older, I start recognising -- and thereby paying homage -- to the few constants I can rely on on a cold slow Sunday. When the yellows start looking like the reds, finding my way back to the never-changing greens always works.

For me, having fun means going back to writing code -- leaving all the rest aside. To that end, today I [wrote a load-shedding server using Spring Boot](https://github.com/mourjo/monster-scale-2025). 

For anyone who needs this: If you are in a rut, find your never-changing greens, _go back out there and have some fucking fun._
