A day in a software engineer's week becomes blurry from one another. It is not uncommon to get caught up in the rut of things. Today happens to be one of those slow Sunday mornings at the end of a busy week. 

Sure, I do many things at my job that I have grown to love (the yellows) -- writing about software, designing systems, technical leadership, planning... All of the things I have grown to love have their roots somehow to what I truly enjoy doing, even on a gloomy winter morning (the greens): writing code -- for no reason, for no outcome, for no one -- just me building something where there was nothing.

On good weeks, the yellows often become greens, and the reds start looking like yellows. I know I am having a bad day when the yellows start resembling the reds. As I grow older, I start recognising -- and thereby paying homage -- to the few constants I can rely on on a cold slow Sunday -- the never-changing greens.

In the show, Ted Lasso, football is to the players, what software engineering is to me -- I do it because I enjoy it. In all honesty though, I would be lying if I said I love every bit of it.

For me, having fun means going back to writing code -- leaving all the rest aside. To that end, today I [wrote a load-shedding server using Spring Boot](https://github.com/mourjo/monster-scale-2025). 

For anyone who needs this: If you are in a rut, find your never-changing greens, _go back out there and have some fucking fun._
