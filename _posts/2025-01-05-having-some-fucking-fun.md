A day in a software engineer's week becomes blurry from one another. It is not uncommon to get caught up in the rut of things. Today happens to be a slow Sunday morning at the end of a busy week. I have a lot of reading to catch up on, but I just cannot concentrate on any of it.

I was watching Ted Lasso the other day - and I recall this quote. Football is to the players, what software engineering is to me. I always found joy in it - yet on slow days like this, it is hard to get the needle moving.

> I brought you here to remind you that football is a fucking game that you used to play as a fucking kid because it was fun. Even when you were getting your fucking legs broken or your fucking feelings hurt. So fuck your feelings, fuck your overthinking, fuck all that bullshit. Go back out there and have some fucking fun.

For me, having fun means going back to coding -- leaving all the piling work aside -- just building something where there was nothing. Today it is about [writing a load-shedding server using Spring Boot](https://github.com/mourjo/monster-scale-2025).
