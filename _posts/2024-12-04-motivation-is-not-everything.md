This year, I did not miss a single day of learning French on Duolingo, even if only for
five minutes. Through it, I learnt a lot about the process of learning, looking back:
  
- **Motivation** comes and goes, relying on motivation alone is unsustainable
- There will be good days and there will be better days
- **Showing up every day** is winning half the battle
- I overestimated what I can do in **one day**
- I underestimated what I can do in **one year**
  
There are very few things that pay off as much as self-discipline and habit forming.
