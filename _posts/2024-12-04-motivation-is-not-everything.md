This year, I did not miss a single day of learning French on Duolingo, even if only for five minutes. Through it, I learnt a lot about the process of learning, looking back:  
  
- **Motivation** comes and goes, relying on motivation alone is unsustainable  
- There will be good days and there will be better days  
- **Showing up every day** is winning half the battle  
- I overestimated what I can do in a day  
- I underestimated what I can do in a year  
  
There are very few things that pay off as much as self discipline and habit forming.
