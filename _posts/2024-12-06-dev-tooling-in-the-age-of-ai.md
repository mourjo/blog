I have worked with unconventional languages all [throughout my career](https://mourjo.me/cv.pdf) - from Clojure and Elixir to bash and lately, Perl. Whether statically typed or not, the success of a language (among other things) *depends on the developer tooling and developer experience in general*. Or have I been spoilt by [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)?

Code is only just a means to an end — the end being value addition for the customer. Languages with extensive tooling make it easier for developers, and thereby increasing their value proposition to the business. 

The effectiveness of the median developer for a long time has been dependent on the tooling a language ecosystem has - finding usages of a method, renaming a method, stepping through a codepath just to see where something gets updated, and so on...

Now that there are LLMs to assist developers writing code, I think *the value-proposition of developer tooling will take a new shape*. There will always be a need for some sort of tooling, but it may turn out to be *general purpose tools*, rather than *language-specific ones* that come out on top.

In a world where the barrier to entry into coding is lower - the test of a language's success will depend solely on its ability to deliver business value. If a language is fundamentally more effective in doing so -- irrespective of its tooling -- it may come out on top in the age of AI. After years of working with Java (and relying heavily the tooling ecosystem), I will now be betting on Clojure.

> It is just simpler, and easier, and less occluding to write expressive code in Clojure. It requires fewer lines. It require fewer characters. It require fewer hours. It requires fewer mental gymnastics. Lisp (Clojure) is functional. And the future is looking very functional to me.

The need for solving missing language pieces with tooling is the kind of [accidental complexity](https://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2010/03/18/essential-and-accidental-complexity/) that today’s tech ecosystem is stymied by. AI might just level the playing field for programming languages by eliminating **the over reliance on tooling to solve language problems**. Think about it — would you write Java without Lombok or IntelliJ? If the answer is no, you are probably using Java for the wrong reasons.
