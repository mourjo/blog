I have worked with unconventional languages all [throughout my career](https://mourjo.me/cv.pdf) - from `Clojure` and `Elixir` to `bash` and  `Perl`. Whether statically typed or not, the success of a language (among other things) *depends on the developer tooling and developer experience in general*. Or have I been spoilt by [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)?

Code is only just a means for the business to add value for its customer. Languages with extensive tooling make it easier for developers, and thereby increasing their value proposition to the business. The effectiveness of the median developer for a long time has been dependent on the tooling a language ecosystem has. Much more than the language fundamentals, I believe *tooling is a bigger contributor to a developer's success today* - finding usages of a method, renaming a method, stepping through a codepath just to see where something gets updated, and so on...

Now that there are LLMs to assist developers writing code, I think *the value-proposition of developer tooling will take a new shape*. There will always be a need some sort of tooling, but it may turn out to be *general purpose tools*, rather than *language-specific ones* that come out on top.

After years of working with Java (and relying heavily the tooling ecosystem), I will now be betting on `Clojure`, as did [Uncle Bob in 2019](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2019/08/22/WhyClojure.html).
