"Accidental quality" â€” that's what I call the hidden trap in traditional example-based tests.  
  
In my recent talk at Techcamp Hamburg, I spoke about how enumerating test cases creates a dangerous illusion of safety, while the real bugs hide in the blindspots we never think to check.  
  
Property-based testing flips the narrative: it searches for bugs instead of just testing for them. If you have 1000 users and you are writing 50 handpicked test cases - are you sure you are not missing any particular use-case?
