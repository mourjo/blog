title:  "Thanks for those 100 stars!"
---

I'm glad that you guys have liked and supported the theme to reach 100 stars on Github. I would like to thank everyone who has supported the theme by using, starring and recommending it.

Themes get better when people contribute. That is how our [Online CV](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv){: target="_blank"} got more than 250 likes. I would like to ask users to suggest changes and if possible create a pull-request. 

You can still do it if you haven't yet, <a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/sharu725/hagura" data-style="mega" data-count-href="/sharu725/hagura/stargazers" data-count-api="/repos/sharu725/hagura#stargazers_count" data-count-aria-label="# stargazers on GitHub" aria-label="Star sharu725/hagura on GitHub">Star</a>
<script async defer src="https://buttons.github.io/buttons.js"></script>

Thank you
