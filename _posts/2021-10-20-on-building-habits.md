During the last five years of my working life, I have come to realise that there are few
things that pay off in the long run as much as the ability to form habits easily. In
retrospect, starting to do something like working out every other day, reading at a
particular time of day, preparing for teaching a lesson -- all have benefited from
repetitive incremental progress through habits. Here are three things that have helped me
build habits.

- **Anchoring**: While building habits, it is easier to associate the new activity to an
  existing habit that you're used to. For example, if going out for a run is already part
  of your day, then adding a post-run task like having your pills is easier than
  remembering to have it at 7 am. Once a habit becomes part of the day, it can then become
  an anchor for another new habit.

- **Planning**: Part of building a habit is repetition, and for something to be
  repeatable, it should not change much. That is, chalk out a plan beforehand, maybe the
  previous day (tweak it if required) but stick to it through thick and thin -- take
  the thinking or optionality out of the activity. If I am planning to run 5 km in the
  morning, the option of cutting the run short should not even be present. A more detailed
  plan, for example, a 1 km pre-run warm up and a post run cool down, takes the thinking
  out of the picture and knowing it is obligatory even in those days that are
  tiring, makes build the habit.

- **Reviewing**: One of the best things a smart watch has helped me with, in so far as
  workouts are considered, is a review of the last day/week's activities. If I had been
  able to do all of my workouts in the week, looking back and reviewing it is a great
  sense of accomplishment, while not being able to do so is a reason to push harder in the
  next day/week. In terms of general habit-building, such reviewing of past activities has
  helped me make a conscious effort for those missed triggers, because as humans those are
  bound to happen.
