"If you care about keeping your phone code secret, you should use this", the seller said, emphatically pointing to the privacy screen guard. I knew about privacy-protecting screen guards, but I was not looking to buy one when I was at [Gariahat](https://www.tripadvisor.in/Attraction_Review-g304558-d6412735-Reviews-Gariahat_Market-Kolkata_Calcutta_Kolkata_District_West_Bengal.html) market a couple of weeks ago. Nevertheless, I gave in and got one for myself and I would do it again because with it, I became more productive.

With a privacy screen protector, no one other than the person holding a phone can see what is on the screen. I had never used one before, so I did not know the screen protector had its drawbacks -- the brightness of the screen became lower and the screen resolution looked like it a phone from the past decade. I have to admit, I was quite fond of my new phone's screen, but with this protector on it, I kept having to zoom in and squint my eyes to read text. Quite heartbreakingly, for the first time in three years, I could almost see individual pixels on a screen. 

I had half a mind to remove the protector entirely, until in the most surprising turn of events, I subconsciously started spending less time on the phone. The lesser appeal of the screen and just that slight struggle to read text and view content nudged me towards spending time doing other -- more productive -- things than looking at reels on Youtube. 

Since that day at Gariahat -- two weeks ago now -- I have been more attentive, faster while reading technical documents, been getting more sleep, finished reading the long-pending book [Hail Mary](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/149264531-mourjo-sen?utf8=✓&utf8=✓&shelf=read&title=mourjo-sen&sort=date_read&order=d), started reading the [Mistborn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68428.Mistborn) series and finished preparing my presentation for my upcoming talk at [Monster Scale 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al8Zp3sBYQM&list=PLSV-L4GsXwgn6rhNyjnLMLEtU4cNCPpdB&index=3). Doing all of this in a span of two weeks, while traveling, would sound undoable to me just a month ago.

Although I never doom scroll on Instagram or spend too long looking at my phone screen, I do look at my phone every now and then -- watching videos or scrolling through Bluesky or Reddit. I realize now, that it is not the amount of time I spend on the phone that was detrimental to my productivity -- it is the persistent interruptions to my flow of work that is. Having a screen that takes away some of the gratification of social media by adding a little bit of struggle to view the content, quite counter-intuitively, lowers my urge to use my phone, giving me back precious time I could spend doing just about anything else. I now use my phone when I need to do something, not for entertainment.

I want phones to become what they were always intended to be -- devices to help us with our daily tasks, instead of the addiction that they have become. Therefore, I wish today's smart phones had poorer screens, but without sacrificing any of the functionalities that make our digital lives easier. But I doubt that the phone industry will allow that to happen -- after all, our addiction to phones is their source of revenue. It is therefore on us to find ways to make our phones less pleasureful.

Next time you are at Gariahat market, consider getting yourself a privacy screen protector -- not because you need the privacy, but because you want to get back your productivity.
