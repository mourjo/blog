The dawn quietly crept in through the cracked windows. Lazy and exhausted from a week-long trip, I teetered on the precipice of skipping the weekly workout class. My muscles whispered for a softer start to the weekend. Yet, propelled by some unseen force, I went. And there, amidst the prosaic mundanity of a routine class, something profound unravelled.

Five minutes into the class, Mr O., our instructor, a strong disciplinarian, whispered something in Dutch into the microphone. To my utter bewilderment, he then began to sing. A ripple of confused expressions spread through the room, mirroring my own confusion. The reason unfurled itself as my eyes scanned the class. One of our classmates, recently diagnosed with liver cancer, had achieved the impossible. After months of what I can only imagine to be a despairing hell, she stood among us, miraculously returned. 

Mr O.'s song was a standing ovation to her perseverance and her indomitable spirit -- a spirit that eclipses any strength training session. If such a moment doesn't stir the soul, ignite a longing for a higher purpose, to be a better self, to find meaning in the ordinary, what possibly could? 

I missed both classes last week and I almost didn't go today -- yet, through some inexplicable coincidence, I was there, just where I needed to be -- to be part of something bigger, to get a chance to cry with someone, to partake in the celebration of life. Call it coincidence, call it divine intervention, call it a miracle. Just another Saturday's prosaic mundanity transcended into poetic resurgence. 

If you need reasons to believe, it's right there -- you just need to look.
