Oitee is convinced that he can learn Computer Science basics as a part-time activity. I
decided to help him with this endeavour. Being from a non-technical background, his
knowledge of Computer Science is limited to high school HelloWorlds. It is both a huge
responsibility and honour for me to be part of his journey. My paramount goal is to ensure
the gets a _good enough_ guidance to venture into this field. The weight of being able to
show the right path is heavy, but it is worth trying.


Here's what I have in mind (it is probably going to change). I have created the following
broad headings of what I think are the most useful areas to spend time on.

1. CS fundamentals
   * Computer Architecture
   * Networking
   * Operating Systems
   * Databases
   * Basics of a compiler
2. Programming
   * Javascript basics from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#claim-cert-block)
   * Data structures
   * Algorithms
   * Problem solving (something like [Leetcode](http://leetcode.com))
   * Functional languages / OOP
3. Tooling workflows
   * Linux CLI
   * Git
   * Visual Studio Code
4. Web Development (after 1)
   * Server / Client
   * Web scale, components, technologies


I pondered a lot on which language and IDE to suggest for him to learn. Eventually I concluded
that Javascript and VS Code seem to be the most ubiquitous combination there is for web
development. [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/full-stack-web-development)
also seems to be favouring Javascript.

The list above is biased on what I think I am good enough to guide with. Much to the same
reason, there is no mention of machine learning or frontend technologies like CSS,
although a bit of that might be necessary.

At the end of six months from now, based on the progress, my objective is for him to be
ready for applying to coding bootcamps like [Recurse Centre](https://www.recurse.com). If
not that, then with some more work, a candidate for applying to junior engineering
positions, like I did back in 2015 -- only better than what I was back then.

In an effort to prove to myself that I could take on this long and ardous (and eventually
rewarding) journey, I hope to publish regular posts here about the progress I am making as
a guide, so stay tuned and if you're reading this, wish me luck!
