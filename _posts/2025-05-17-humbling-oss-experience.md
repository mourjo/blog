Carl Sagan said astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. I think it is very apt for open-source contributions too. Software building is as much about the human society we live in, as it is about the engineering of it. 

Giving back -- even in its tiniest form -- reaps happiness, fulfillment and on some level, a connection with people who share our tiny slice of Earth's unending history. 

A long time ago, I wrote a small utility, very specific for [my (very niche) use case](https://medium.com/helpshift-engineering/a-study-in-parallelising-tests-b5253817beae). I had no expectation of anyone even hearing about it, let alone use it. The idea was simple - a mechanism to concurrently redefine a function in Clojure. There was only one intended user: me. But for some inexplicable reason, in 2019, I put it out in the open as a [Github gist](https://gist.github.com/mourjo/c7fc03e59eb96f8a342dfcabd350a927). 

I recall Matthew Davidson reaching out to me to extract it into [a library](https://github.com/mourjo/dynamic-redef/tree/main), which Matthew also mentioned in a [blog post](https://modulolotus.net/blog/2022-06-22-tidd/) in 2022. Today, the original gist has 29 chats and the library has been [downloaded 509 times](https://clojars.org/me.mourjo/dynamic-redef) and with 19 stars on Github. 

It's not a lot, but to me, it means the world: 19 people found the idea interesting, which is 19 more than what I had anticipated. If you would like to [contribute](https://github.com/mourjo/dynamic-redef/tree/main), you will forever have my gratitude, as do the authors of all the open source libraries I use every day.
