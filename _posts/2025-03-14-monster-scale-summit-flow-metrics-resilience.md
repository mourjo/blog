In March this year, I spoke at the Monster Scale Summit 2025, organised by ScyllaDB. It was a career high point to be in this picture -- an elite line of speakers, whose books and talks quite literally taught me the craft of software engineering.

About sharing the stage with stalwarts of the industry, I got mentioned in a [commit](https://github.com/niledatabase/niledatabase/commit/2301291de907034f3d987ff1e8f0988c0e49ce0b) by Gwen Shapira (also a speaker at this conference) for flagging a typo in Nile's [website](https://www.thenile.dev) -- a fanboy moment for me!

Anyway, I digress -- here is the video to my talk.
